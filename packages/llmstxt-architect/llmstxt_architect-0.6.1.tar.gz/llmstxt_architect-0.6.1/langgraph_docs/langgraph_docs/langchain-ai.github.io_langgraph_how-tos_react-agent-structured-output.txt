[How to force tool-calling agent to structure output](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/react-agent-structured-output): LLM should read this page when needing to force tool-calling agents to produce structured output, implementing consistent output formats for downstream software, or choosing between single-LLM vs two-LLM structured output approaches. The page explains two methods for implementing structured output with tool-calling agents: binding output as a tool (single LLM approach) and using two LLMs with structured output conversion, with code examples for both approaches using LangGraph.
