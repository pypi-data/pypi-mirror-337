# SLEEPY
Spins in Liouville space for rElaxation and Exchange in PYthon

SLEEPY is software intended for the simulation of NMR spin-systems including exchange processes and relaxation. Includes easy setup of the spin system, and allows application of arbitrary pulse sequences in both the rotating- and lab-frames.

Currently under development. Requires standard python packages plus numpy/scipy/matplotlib.

While the number of known issues has been greatly reduced, testing is still underway. It may be a good idea to contact us and ask if your specific simulation should run correctly. Most simulations, however, should work at this point.
