      api_level: The targeted API level used by the code where the returned API
        session will be used. The maximum API level you may use is defined by the
        device class. HF2 only supports API level 1 and other devices support
        API level 6. You should try to use the maximum level possible to enable
        extended API features.

        if the targeted device is an MF* device or a local data server is running.
        In this case it will try to connect to the local data server or device
        internal data server (local server has priority).

      allow_version_mismatch: If set to True, the connection to the data-server
        will succeed even if the data-server is on a different version of LabOne.

    scipy.io.loadmat().

      A nested dictionary containing the instrument data as
      specified in the LabOne User Interface. The nested structure of ``data``
      corresponds to the path of the data's node in the instrument's node
      hierarchy.

    Further comments:
      The MAT file saved by the LabOne User Interface (UI) is a Matlab V5.0 data
      file. The LabOne UI saves the specified data using native Matlab data
      structures in the same format as are returned by commands in the LabOne
      Matlab API. More specifically, these data structures are nested Matlab
      structs, the nested structure of which correspond to the location of the
      data in the instrument's node hierarchy.

      Matlab structs are returned by scipy.io.loadmat() as dictionaries, the
      name of the struct becomes a key in the dictionary. However, as for all
      objects in MATLAB, structs are in fact arrays of structs, where a single
      struct is an array of shape (1, 1). This means that each (nested)
      dictionary that is returned (corresponding to a node in node hierarchy) is
      loaded by scipy.io.loadmat as a 1-by-1 array and must be indexed as
      such. See the ``Example`` section below.
