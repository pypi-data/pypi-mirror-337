# SPGMI CIQ Python Library

The Python Software Development Kit (SDK) makes REST API integration into your Python environment easier, allowing less technical and experienced Python users to start utilizing REST APIs sooner.

S&P Capital API clients can now access these SDKs to integrate end-of-day and time-series Financial and Market data such as income statements, balance sheets, pricing, and dividend information data points from the S&P Capital IQ API into their Python workflows.

The SDK seamlessly integrates with pandas DataFrames, providing a Jupyter-friendly environment and a simpler, optimized data analysis experience.

With the latest update, the SDK now features the Data Widgets Library. These new functions reflect data available on our S&P Global Capital IQ Pro platform widgets, driving seamless integration into your Python environment for streamlined access to financial, market, ESG data, and moreâ€”all in an optimized, analysis-ready format.
## Features

Integrate high-quality data with your systems, portals, and business applications, including:
1. Income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow values for backtesting models.
2. Basic automation of desktop/Excel-based modeling when Excel templates reach their limit.
3. Time-series pricing and market data values in addition to dividend information.

## Benefits
1. Output generated in a reusable/extendible object such as a DataFrame, facilitating easy data processing and analysis.
2. Ease of authentication, request, and response handling.
3. Ability to use proxy objects for enhanced network communication.
4. Simplified SDK setup with robust error handling and token management.
