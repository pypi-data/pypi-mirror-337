[How to create a sequence of steps](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/sequence/): LLM should read this page when implementing sequential workflows in LangGraph, creating multi-step processes in applications, or learning about state management in graph-based systems. This page explains how to create sequences in LangGraph, covering methods for building sequential graphs using .add_node/.add_edge or the shorthand .add_sequence, defining state with TypedDict, creating nodes as functions that update state, and compiling/invoking graphs with examples.
