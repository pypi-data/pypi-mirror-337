## What is it?
**thinking-hats-ai** is a Python package that facilitates idea generation by following Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats methodology from his [Book](https://swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_NETWORK/1ufb5t2/alma991081046019705501). It enables you to generate ideas by selecting one of the six hats and lets you choose one of the implemented prompting technique to follow while generating the idea.

## Use of Package
### Example script
This example uses the `CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT` [prompting techniques](#prompting-techniques) and the `BLACK` [hat](#hats) for the personality. It also uses [developer mode](#developer-mode) to log the interaction in a separate file.
```python
### Import package
import thinking_hats_ai

### Create session
instance = thinking_hats_ai.BrainstormingSession('YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY')
instance.dev = True

### Define current status
brainstormingInput = thinking_hats_ai.BrainstormingInput(
    question='how could you make students come to class more often even though there are podcasts provided for each lecture?',
    ideas=["Implement an interactive class participation system with incentives, such as extra credit or digital badges, encouraging students to attend and engage actively.","Introduce mandatory interactive workshops that supplement lecture content with hands-on activities and problem-solving sessions."],
    response_length='max 10 sentences'
)

### Generate output
idea = instance.generate_idea(
    thinking_hats_ai.Technique.CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT,
    thinking_hats_ai.Hat.BLACK,
    'how could you make students come to class more often even though there are podcasts provided for each lecture?'
)

###Â Print output
print(idea)
```

### Hats
The different hats act as a predefined persona according to Edward de Bono's book about the six thinking hats in brainstorming. You can select which persona should be used for your instance.
Hat   | Role
----  | ----
BLACK | TODO
WHITE | TODO
YELLOW| TODO
GREEN | TODO
BLUE  | TODO
RED   | TODO

### Prompting techniques
The different prompting techniques help to analyse different approaches of idea generation for each hat. While implementing, we analyzed which of the techniques work best for which hat.
Technique        | Explanation
----             | ----
CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT | TODO


### Brainstorming-input
The instance of BrainstormingInput allows you to pass the brainstorming `question`, `ideas`and `response_length` to the generation of an idea.
Variable Name    | Explanation
----             | ----
question         | This variable takes a `string`, a question what the ideas are about
ideas            | This variable takes a `list of strings` where each string is a idea from the brainstorming
response_length  | This variable takes a `string` which will control the length of the answer. You can say "10 sentences" but also things like "similar to the other ideas"


### Developer mode
The developer mode is used to log the in/outputs of the api calls. This was implemented for prompt engineering purposes and help to analyse the history of all API calls made. 

It can be activated by setting the `dev` attribute to `True` or `False`:
```python
instance.dev = True / False
```


## Installation
This package is available through the [Python
Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/thinking-hats-ai).

```sh
pip install thinking-hats-ai
```


## Dependencies
- [LangChain - A framework for developing applications powered by language models](https://www.langchain.com)


## Background
The implementation of ``thinking-hats-ai`` started at [UZH](https://www.uzh.ch) as a part of three bachelors theses.
