## Development and Testing

### Setting up Development Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv test_env
   source test_env/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   test_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[test]"
   ```

### Running Tests

The game includes a comprehensive test suite that verifies core functionality. To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest src/tests/

# Run tests with verbose output
python -m pytest src/tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage report
python -m pytest src/tests/ --cov=terminal_snake_game
```

The test suite covers:
- Snake movement and collision detection
- Food generation and placement
- Score tracking
- Window management and display
- Game mechanics validation

When contributing new features, please ensure to:
1. Add appropriate test cases
2. Run the full test suite before submitting changes
3. Maintain or improve the current test coverage
