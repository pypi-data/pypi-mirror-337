# ⚠️ keyed-extras Placeholder Package ⚠️

## This is NOT the real keyed-extras package!

This is a placeholder package to prevent potential security issues for users of the `keyed` animation library.

The real `keyed-extras` package is only available to sponsors and contains additional features for the `keyed` animation library.

## How to get the real keyed-extras package

1. Visit [https://dougmercer.github.io/keyed/extras/](https://dougmercer.github.io/keyed/extras/)
2. Become a sponsor to gain access
3. Follow the installation instructions to configure pip with the correct `extra-index-url`

## Why this package exists

This placeholder package exists to:
- Prevent malicious actors from releasing packages with similar names
- Protect users from accidentally installing the wrong package
- Direct legitimate users to the correct sponsorware program

If you installed this package expecting the full functionality of `keyed-extras`, please visit the page linked above.

## Security Information

Installing packages from PyPI always carries some risk. Always verify you're installing the package you intend to use. Package name confusion or "typosquatting" is a common attack vector for distributing malware.

This package contains minimal functionality and merely alerts users that they need to access the sponsorware version instead.
