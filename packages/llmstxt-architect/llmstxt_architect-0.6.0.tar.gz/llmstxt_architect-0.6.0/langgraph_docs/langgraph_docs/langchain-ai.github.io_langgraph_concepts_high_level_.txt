[Why LangGraph?](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/): LLM should read this page when understanding LangGraph's core capabilities, exploring LLM application infrastructure, or evaluating agent/workflow persistence options. LangGraph provides infrastructure for LLM applications with three key benefits: persistence for memory and human-in-the-loop capabilities, streaming of workflow events and LLM outputs, and tools for debugging and deployment via LangGraph Platform.
