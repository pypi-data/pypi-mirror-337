[How to: summarize text through iterative refinement](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/summarize_refine): LLM should read this page when: 1. Attempting to summarize long texts through iterative refinement 2. Learning about building applications with LangGraph 3. Seeking examples of streaming LLM outputs 'This guide demonstrates how to summarize text through iterative refinement using LangGraph. It involves splitting the text into documents, summarizing the first document, and then refining the summary based on subsequent documents until finished. The approach leverages LangGraph's streaming capabilities and modularity.'
