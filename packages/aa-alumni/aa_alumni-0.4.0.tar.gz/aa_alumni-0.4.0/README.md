## Features

- Integration with Alliance Auth's State System, creates and maintains an Alumni State for past members of an Alliance and/or Corporation.

    'schedule': crontab(minute="0", hour="0", day_of_week="4"),
    'apply_offset': True,
}

    'task': 'alumni.tasks.update_all_models',

    'apply_offset': True,
}
```

### Step 4 - Update AA's State system
