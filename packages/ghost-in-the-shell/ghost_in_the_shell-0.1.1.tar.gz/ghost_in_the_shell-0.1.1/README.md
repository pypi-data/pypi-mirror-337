# 🧠 AI Shell

**AI Shell** is a cross-platform command-line assistant that lets you use natural language to run shell commands. Whether you’re on macOS, Linux, or Windows, just type what you want to do — AI Shell will suggest the correct shell command, ask for your confirmation, and optionally execute it.

Supports both:
- **One-shot mode**: `ai "untar this file"` → returns shell command
- **Interactive mode**: `ai -i` → opens a terminal chat with the AI
