## Installation

You can install SmartPredict using pip:

```bash
pip install smartpredict
```

## Features

- **Advanced Model Selection**: Supports a wide range of models, including tree-based methods, neural networks, and more.
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Optuna for efficient hyperparameter optimization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes tools for automated feature creation and selection.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implements stacking, blending, and voting techniques.
- **Model Explainability**: Provides SHAP and LIME for interpretability.
- **Parallel Processing**: Speeds up model training and evaluation.

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started:

```python
from smartpredict import SmartClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = load_breast_cancer()
X = data.data
y = data.target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=123)

clf = SmartClassifier(verbose=1)
results = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

## Usage

### Classification

```python
from smartpredict import SmartClassifier

# Your code for loading and splitting data

clf = SmartClassifier(verbose=1)
results = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

### Regression

```python
from smartpredict import SmartRegressor

# Your code for loading and splitting data

reg = SmartRegressor(verbose=1)
results = reg.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

## Advanced Features

### Hyperparameter Tuning

SmartPredict uses Optuna for hyperparameter optimization:

```python
clf = SmartClassifier(hyperparameter_tuning=True)
results = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

### Feature Engineering

Automated feature engineering to improve model performance:

```python
from smartpredict import SmartClassifier

clf = SmartClassifier(feature_engineering=True)
results = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

### Explainability

Model explainability with SHAP:

```python
clf = SmartClassifier(explainability=True)
results = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

### Ensemble Methods

Combine multiple models for better performance:

```python
clf = SmartClassifier(ensemble_methods=True)
results = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(results)
```

## Model Assessment

SmartPredict provides comprehensive model assessment metrics to evaluate your machine learning models. Here is how you can use it:

```python
from smartpredict import ModelAssessment

# Assuming model, X_test, and y_test are defined
assessment = ModelAssessment(model, X_test, y_test)
results = assessment.summary()

print("Model Assessment Metrics:")
print(f"Accuracy: {results['accuracy']}")
print(f"Precision: {results['precision']}")
print(f"Recall: {results['recall']}")
print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']}")
print(f"Confusion Matrix: {results['confusion_matrix']}")
print(f"ROC AUC: {results['roc_auc']}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(results['classification_report'])
```
