# Valthon

Python with Valorant.

Valthon is a Python preprosessor which translates regular Python code into Valorant maddness, because why not? After losing a game of Valorant, you can now go back to your code and see the same thing. The only difference is that you can not blame your teammates for the code.

## Installation

You can install Valthon directly from PyPI using `pip`. (You might need to use `sudo` and `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on your system or `uv` ðŸ˜‰)

```shell
pip install valthon
```

## Code example

#### Python - main.py

```python
def test() -> None:
    print("Hello World!")

test()
```

#### Valthon - main.vln

```python
loadout test() -> afk:
    chat("Hello World!")

test()
```

## Quick intro

Valthon works by first translating Valthon-files (suggested file ending: `.vln`) into Python-files, and then using Python to run them. You therefore need a working installation of Python for Valthon to work.

To run a Valthon program from the command line

```shell
valthon main.vln
```

For a full list of options

```shell
valthon -h
```

Valthon also includes a translator from Python to Valthon. This will create a Valthon file called `test.vln` from a Python file called `test.py`.

```shell
py2vln test.py
```

For a full list of options

```shell
py2vln -h
```

## Mapping

Below is a table of all of the Python keywords or operators that should be replaced by their corresponding Valthon keyword. Python keywords that don't have a mapping or aren't in this table can just be used as is.

Note: You can also use the Python keywords in the Valthon code, ie. you can use `if` instead of `clutch or kick` in `.vln` files.
