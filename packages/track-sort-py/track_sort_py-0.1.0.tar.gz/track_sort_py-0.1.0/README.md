# Track SORT

This is a implementation of the SIMPLE ONLINE AND REALTIME TRACKING paper [1],
or SORT for short, for Python.

It essentially wraps the Rust implementation from https://gitlab.com/leandrosansilva/track-sort-rs

Its interface differs considerably from the original reference implementation
from https://github.com/abewley/sort.

## TODO

- Document it
- Benchmark it against reference implementation
