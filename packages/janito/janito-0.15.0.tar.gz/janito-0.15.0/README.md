## 🔧 Available Tools

Janito comes with several built-in tools:
- 📄 `str_replace_editor` - View, create, and edit files with configurable display limits
- 🔎 `find_files` - Find files matching patterns
- 🗑️ `delete_file` - Delete files
- 🔍 `search_text` - Search for text patterns in files
- 🌐 `fetch_webpage` - Fetch and extract content from web pages
- 📋 `move_file` - Move files from one location to another
- 💻 `bash` - Execute bash commands with real-time output display
- 🧠 `think` - Tool to record thoughts for complex reasoning

## 📊 Usage Tracking

Janito includes a comprehensive token usage tracking system that helps you monitor API costs:

- **Basic tracking**: By default, Janito displays a summary of token usage and cost after each query
- **Detailed reporting**: Use the `--show-tokens` flag to see detailed breakdowns including:
  - Input and output token counts
  - Per-tool token usage statistics
  - Precise cost calculations
  - Cache performance metrics with savings analysis
  - Line delta tracking for file modifications

## 📄 Enhanced File Viewing

The str_replace_editor tool now includes improved file viewing capabilities:

- **Configurable Display Limits**: Set the maximum number of lines to display before showing a warning
- **Warning Instead of Truncation**: When a file exceeds the configured line limit, a warning is shown but the full content is still displayed
- **Customizable Limits**: Configure the `max_view_lines` setting to adjust the threshold (default: 500 lines)

```bash
# Set a custom maximum view lines threshold globally
janito --set-global-config "max_view_lines=1000"

# Set a project-specific threshold
janito --set-local-config "max_view_lines=250"
```

This improvement ensures you always see the complete file content while still being warned about potentially large files.

```bash
# Show detailed token usage and cost information
janito --show-tokens "Write a Python function to sort a list"

# Basic usage (shows simplified token usage summary)
janito "Explain Docker containers"

# Use trust mode for concise output without tool details
janito --trust "Create a simple Python script"
# Or use the short alias
janito -t "Create a simple Python script"
```

The usage tracker automatically calculates cache savings, showing you how much you're saving by reusing previous responses.

## 📋 Parameter Profiles

Janito offers predefined parameter profiles to optimize Claude's behavior for different tasks:

- **precise**: Factual answers, documentation, structured data (temperature: 0.2)
- **balanced**: Professional writing, summarization, everyday tasks (temperature: 0.5)
- **conversational**: Natural dialogue, educational content (temperature: 0.7)
- **creative**: Storytelling, brainstorming, marketing copy (temperature: 0.9)
- **technical**: Code generation, debugging, technical problem-solving (temperature: 0.3)

```bash
# Use a specific profile
janito --profile creative "Write a poem about coding"

# View available profiles
janito --show-config
```

## 🔇 Trust Mode

Janito offers a trust mode that suppresses tool outputs for a more concise execution experience:

### How It Works

- When enabled with `--trust` or `-t`, Janito suppresses informational and success messages from tools
- Only essential output and error messages are displayed
- The final result from Claude is still shown in full
- Trust mode is a per-session setting and not saved to your configuration

### Using Trust Mode

```bash
# Enable trust mode with the full flag
janito --trust "Create a Python script that reads a CSV file"

# Or use the short alias
janito -t "Create a Python script that reads a CSV file"
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Experienced users who don't need to see every step of the process
- Batch processing or scripting where concise output is preferred
- Focusing on results rather than the process
- Creating cleaner output for documentation or sharing

## 🚫 No-Tools Mode

Janito provides a no-tools mode that disables all file system and external tools for pure AI interactions:

### How It Works

- When enabled with `--no-tools`, Janito disables all tools for the current session
- Claude will respond based purely on its knowledge without accessing or modifying files
- This mode is a per-session setting and not saved to your configuration

### Using No-Tools Mode

```bash
# Enable no-tools mode
janito --no-tools "Explain how Docker containers work"
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Getting general information or explanations without file system access
- Brainstorming sessions where you don't need file operations
- Safer operation in sensitive environments
- Faster responses for queries that don't require tools

## 📝 Custom System Instructions

Janito allows you to provide custom system instructions to change Claude's behavior:

### How It Works

- When provided with `--system` or `-s`, Janito uses your custom instructions instead of the default
- This allows you to create specialized assistant personalities or behaviors
- Custom instructions are a per-session setting and not saved to your configuration

### Using Custom System Instructions

```bash
# Provide custom system instructions
janito --system "You are a poetry expert who speaks in rhymes" "Write about coding"

# Or use the short alias
janito -s "You are a cybersecurity expert" "Review this authentication code"
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Creating specialized assistant personalities
- Focusing Claude on specific domains or expertise
- Setting up specific response formats or styles
- Educational scenarios where you need different expert perspectives

## 💬 Conversation History

Janito automatically saves your conversation history, allowing you to browse, manage, and continue previous discussions:

### How It Works

- Each conversation is saved with a unique message ID in `.janito/last_messages/`
- The most recent conversation is also saved as `.janito/last_message.json` for backward compatibility
- After each conversation, Janito displays the command to continue that specific conversation

### Browsing Your History

You can view your conversation history with the `--history` flag:

```bash
# Show the 20 most recent conversations (default)
janito --history

# Show a specific number of recent conversations
janito --history 10
```

This displays a table with:
- Conversation ID
- Date and time
- First query from each conversation

### Using the Continue Feature

```bash
# Continue the most recent conversation
janito --continue "Add more details to your previous response"

# Continue a specific conversation using its ID
janito --continue abc123def "Let's modify that code you suggested"

# Just use --continue without arguments to continue the most recent conversation
# and be prompted for your next query
janito --continue

# Alternative way to continue a specific conversation
janito --continue-id abc123def "Let's modify that code you suggested"
```

The `--continue` flag (or `-c` for short) allows you to:
- Resume the most recent conversation when used without an ID
- Resume a specific conversation when provided with a message ID
- Maintain context across multiple interactions for complex tasks

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Multi-step development tasks
- Iterative code improvements
- Continuing discussions after system interruptions
- Maintaining context when working on complex problems
