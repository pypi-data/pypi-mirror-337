[How to add cross-thread persistence to your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/cross-thread-persistence): LLM should read this page when needing to implement persistence across multiple threads in LangGraph, when storing user data between conversations, or when implementing shared memory in graph-based LLM applications. This page demonstrates how to use LangGraph's Store API to persist data across threads, including creating an InMemoryStore with embedding search capabilities, passing stores to graph nodes, and accessing user-specific memories in different conversation threads.
