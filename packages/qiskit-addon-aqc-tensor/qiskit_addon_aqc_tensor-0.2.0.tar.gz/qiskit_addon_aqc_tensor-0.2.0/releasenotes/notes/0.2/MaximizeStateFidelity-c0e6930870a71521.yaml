    The ``OneMinusFidelity`` objective function has been renamed and
    is now known as :class:`.MaximizeStateFidelity`.  As a related
    change, one should now call the
    :meth:`~.MaximizeStateFidelity.loss_function` method to obtain the
    value and gradient of the loss function, instead of calling the
    instance directly (through its ``__call__`` method).
