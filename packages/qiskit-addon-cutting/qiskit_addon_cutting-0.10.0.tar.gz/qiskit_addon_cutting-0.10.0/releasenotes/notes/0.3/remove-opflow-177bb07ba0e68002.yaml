    The dependency on the :mod:`qiskit.opflow` module has been removed from entanglement forging.
    With this change, Qiskit Nature 0.6.0 is now required.
    However, Qiskit Nature 0.6.0 is incompatible with Quantum Serverless, so users that wish to
    use entanglement forging with Quantum Serverless must remain on version 0.2 of the Circuit
    Knitting Toolbox until `issue #108 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/issues/108>`__ is resolved.
