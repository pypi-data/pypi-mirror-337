# Goal
Create a comprehensive mind map of the [CONTENT TYPE] titled "[CONTENT TITLE]" by [CREATOR]. Structure it following the content's natural organization rather than imposing external categories.

# Instructions
- Follow the content's actual structure precisely (sections, topics, segments)
{emoji_instruction_line}- Include multiple levels of detail:
   - Main branches = major sections/themes/topics
   - Sub-branches = subtopics/segments/points
   - Details = key points, concepts, and insights{detail_instruction_suffix}
- For each section/topic, capture multiple key ideas (don't limit to just 3-5)
- Output as a hierarchical list with clear indentation to show relationships
- Begin with the content title as the central node

# Content Types
- For books: Follow parts/chapters/sections
- For articles: Follow sections/headings/subheadings
- For podcasts: Follow episode segments/topics/discussions
- For videos: Follow time segments/themes/key points
- For courses: Follow modules/lessons/concepts
- For presentations: Follow slides/sections/main points

# Example Format

1. Begin with the content title as the central node
2. Create two types of main branches:
   - STRUCTURAL: Follow the content's actual organization (parts/chapters/sections/topics)
   - CONCEPTUAL: Identify 3-5 core concepts/themes that appear throughout regardless of structure

3. For each structural branch:

{emoji_instruction_line}   - Limit each branch to 3-7 key points to maintain clarity

4. For conceptual branches:
   - Map how this concept evolves or appears across different sections
   - Identify supporting evidence/examples from various parts of the content
   - Note any contradictions or tensions within this concept

# Cross-Connections
5. After mapping primary branches, identify at least 5-7 important connections BETWEEN branches
   - Format these as: [Concept A] {'↔️' if use_emoji else '↔'} [Concept B]: [Brief explanation of relationship]
   - Look for unexpected relationships between seemingly unrelated ideas

# Synthesis Elements 
6. Create a "Key Frameworks" section that captures:
   - The author's underlying mental models
   - Core principles that organize their thinking
   - Unstated assumptions that support their arguments

7. Create a "Evolution of Ideas" section that traces how 1-2 central ideas develop throughout

# Visual Format
- Output as a clearly indented hierarchical list 
- Use symbols to indicate relationships:
  - → for cause/effect
  - ↔ for mutual relationships
  - ⊃ for "contains/includes"
  - ≠ for contrasting ideas

You are the second agent in a pipeline:
1. Mind Map Agent has created a structural and conceptual map of the content
2. YOU (Summary Architect) design the summary structure as a series of modules
3. Content Synthesizer will create each module following your specifications, which will be combined into a final summary

# Your Task
Analyze the content's unique characteristics and create a series of clear, specific module assignments that will guide the Content Synthesizer to create a cohesive, deep summary.

# Output Format
1. OVERVIEW ANALYSIS (200 words)
   - Explain the content's unique structure and value
   - Justify your modular breakdown approach

2. MODULAR ASSIGNMENT PLAN
   Create N distinct module assignments with:
   - Module number and title
   - Word count - depending how deep treatment should receive this module
   - SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTENT SYNTHESIZER including:
     * Exact questions this module should answer
     * Key concepts that must be included
     * Examples or illustrations that should be featured
     * Required connections to other modules
     * Style and depth guidelines
   A module can be a section of the content or a particular concept.

3. For EACH module, explicitly format as:

# Remember
- Your assignments must be completely clear and executable by another agent
- Each module should be independently processable but contain clear connection points
- Specify exactly which concepts from the mind map belong in each module
- Create a structure that, when all modules are combined, will form a cohesive learning experience

# Language Requirements
- You MUST write all content in {language}
- KEEP THE FOLLOWING STRUCTURAL KEYWORDS IN ENGLISH EXACTLY AS WRITTEN (do not translate these):

   - Ensure the content naturally incorporates answers to these questions
   - Maintain a logical flow that implicitly responds to all questions

5. CONNECTIONS (if mentioned):
   - Create clear connection points to other modules as specified
   - Prepare your module to fit seamlessly into the larger summary structure

## STEP 1: CONTENT ANALYSIS & MIND MAP CREATION

First, analyze the content thoroughly and create a detailed mind map following these guidelines:

### Mind Map Instructions
1. Begin with the content title as the central node
2. Create TWO types of main branches:
   - **STRUCTURAL MAP**: Follow the content's actual organization (parts/chapters/sections/topics)
   - **CONCEPTUAL MAP**: Identify 3-5 core concepts/themes that appear throughout

3. For the STRUCTURAL MAP:
   - Follow the content's natural structure precisely
   - Map key ideas maintaining clear hierarchical relationships
{emoji_instruction_line}   - Include multiple levels of detail with clear indentation

4. For the CONCEPTUAL MAP:
   - Identify how core concepts evolve or appear across different sections
   - Find supporting evidence/examples from various parts of the content
   - Note any contradictions or tensions within concepts

5. Create CROSS-CONNECTIONS section:
   - Identify 5-7 important connections BETWEEN branches
   - Format as: [Concept A] ↔️ [Concept B]: [Brief explanation of relationship]
   - Look for unexpected relationships between seemingly unrelated ideas

6. Add a KEY FRAMEWORKS section:
   - Capture the author's underlying mental models
   - Identify core principles that organize their thinking
   - Note unstated assumptions that support their arguments

7. Create an EVOLUTION OF IDEAS section:
   - Trace how 1-2 central ideas develop throughout the content

### Mind Map Format
```
# MIND MAP: [CONTENT TITLE]

## {'📚 ' if use_emoji else ''}STRUCTURAL MAP
- [Main Section/Topic 1]
  - [Subsection/Subtopic 1.1]
    - [Key point{example_point_suffix}]
    - [Another key point{example_point_suffix}]
  - [Subsection/Subtopic 1.2]
    ...

## {'🧠 ' if use_emoji else ''}CONCEPTUAL MAP
- [Core Concept 1]
  - Appears in [Section X] as [specific manifestation]
  - Evolves in [Section Y] through [how it changes]
  - Contrasts with [related idea] in [Section Z]
- [Core Concept 2]
  ...

## {'🔄 ' if use_emoji else ''}CROSS-CONNECTIONS
- [Concept A] ↔️ [Concept B]: [Relationship explanation]
- [Chapter X idea] → [Chapter Y idea]: [How one influences the other]
...

## {'🧩 ' if use_emoji else ''}KEY FRAMEWORKS
- [Framework 1]: [Brief explanation of this mental model]
- [Framework 2]: [Brief explanation of this mental model]
...

## {'📈 ' if use_emoji else ''}EVOLUTION OF IDEAS
- [Central Idea]: [Starting point] → [Development] → [Final form]
```

## STEP 2: SUMMARY ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

After completing the mind map, design a modular summary architecture:

1. Write a brief OVERVIEW ANALYSIS (200 words) explaining:
   - The content's unique structure and value
   - Your approach to breaking it down for summarization

2. Create a MODULAR ASSIGNMENT PLAN with 3-7 distinct modules
   - Each module should focus on a coherent section or concept
   - Assign appropriate word counts based on importance
   - Ensure modules connect logically to form a complete summary

3. For each module, specify:
   - The main topic and focus
   - Key concepts that must be included (from your mind map)
   - Specific questions this module should answer
   - How it connects to other modules

## STEP 3: CONTENT SYNTHESIS

Finally, produce the actual summary content for each module:

1. Follow the module specifications exactly
2. Respect assigned word counts
3. Answer all specified questions
4. Include all required concepts
5. Maintain clear connections between modules
6. Write in a clear, engaging, educational style

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Your complete response should be formatted as follows:

```
# MIND MAP: [CONTENT TITLE]
[Complete mind map as specified above]

# SUMMARY ARCHITECTURE
## Overview Analysis
[200-word analysis of content and approach]

## Module Plan
[Brief outline of modules and their relationships]

# MODULAR SUMMARY
## Module 1: [Title]
[Summary content for module 1]

## Module 2: [Title]
[Summary content for module 2]

... and so on for all modules ...
```

Remember to analyze deeply, be comprehensive, and create a summary that captures both the structure and deeper meaning of the content.
