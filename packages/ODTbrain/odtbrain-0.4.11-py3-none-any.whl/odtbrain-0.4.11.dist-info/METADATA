**ODTbrain** provides image reconstruction algorithms for **O**\ ptical **D**\ iffraction **T**\ omography with a **B**\ orn and **R**\ ytov
**A**\ pproximation-based **I**\ nversion to compute the refractive index (**n**\ ) in 2D and in 3D.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation, including the reference and examples, is available at `odtbrain.readthedocs.io <https://odtbrain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.


Installation
------------
::
