## Single-cell language modeling

This package contains routines and definitions for pre-training single-cell (transcriptomic) language models.

Package features:
- Memory-efficient scRNA-seq dataloading from [`h5torch`-compatible HDF5 files](https://github.com/gdewael/h5torch).
- `yaml`-configurable language model training scripts.
- Modular and extendable data preprocessing pipelines.
- A diverse set of downstream tasks to evaluate scLM performance.
- Full reproducibility instructions of our study results via [bento-sc-reproducibility](https://github.com/gdewael/bento-sc-reproducibility).



## Install

`bento-sc` is distributed on PyPI.
```bash
pip install bento-sc
```
Note: The package has been tested with `torch==2.2.2` and `pytorch-lightning==2.2.5`. If you encounter errors with `bento-sc` using more recent version of these two packages, consider downgrading.

You may need to [install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) before running this command in order to ensure the right CUDA kernels for your system are installed.

## Package usage and structure 

Please refer to our [documentation page](https://bento-sc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Academic reproducibility

All config files and scripts that were used to pre-train models and fine-tune them towards downstream tasks are included in a separate GitHub repository: [bento-sc-reproducibility](https://github.com/gdewael/bento-sc-reproducibility).

In addition, all scripts to reproduce the "baselines" in our study are located in the [bento-sc-reproducibility](https://github.com/gdewael/bento-sc-reproducibility) repository.
