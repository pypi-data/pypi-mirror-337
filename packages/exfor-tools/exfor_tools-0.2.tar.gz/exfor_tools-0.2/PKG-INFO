# exfor-tools
Some lightweight tools to grab data from the [EXFOR database](https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor/) using the [x4i3 library](https://github.com/afedynitch/x4i3/), and organize it for visualization and use in the calibration of optical potentials

## quick start
```
 pip install exfor-tools
```

Package hosted at [pypi.org/project/exfor-tools/](https://pypi.org/project/exfor-tools/).
