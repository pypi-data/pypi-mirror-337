# alpha-isnow

**alpha-isnow** is a Python library to load daily asset data (Stocks, ETFs, Indices, and Cryptocurrencies) from Cloudflare R2 and merge them into a single Pandas DataFrame. The library:

- Lists parquet files stored under `bucket_name/ds/<repo_id>/*.parquet` for each asset.
- Validates that the monthly slices (files named as `YYYY.MM.parquet`) are continuous with no missing months.
- Supports loading data concurrently using a configurable number of threads (default is 4).
- Uses Python's built-in logging module to log messages to the console (default level is ERROR).

## Installation

When you install **alpha-isnow** via pip, its dependencies (pandas, s3fs, boto3) will be automatically installed. To install the package:

```bash
pip install alpha-isnow
```

## Usage

```python
from alpha.datasets import load_daily, AssetType

# Load all available months of stock data
df = load_daily(
    asset_type=AssetType.Stocks,
    token={  # Optional, defaults to environment variables
        "R2_ENDPOINT_URL": "your-r2-endpoint",
        "R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-access-key",
        "R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-secret-key",
    }
)

# Load a specific range of months
df_range = load_daily(
    asset_type=AssetType.ETFs, 
    month_range=("2023.01", "2023.03")
)

print(f"Loaded {len(df)} records")
```

The package uses a namespace package structure, so even though the package name is **alpha-isnow**, you import it with `from alpha.datasets import ...`

## Development

### Installation for Development

For development, install the package in editable mode with development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This will install:
- Runtime dependencies (pandas, s3fs, boto3, pyarrow)
- Development tools:
  - pytest: For running tests
  - black: For code formatting
  - isort: For import sorting
  - mypy: For type checking
  - flake8: For code quality checks
  - build: For building distribution packages
  - twine: For uploading to PyPI

### Building and Releasing

To build distribution packages:

```bash
# Build both wheel and source distribution
python -m build

# The packages will be created in the dist/ directory
```

To release to PyPI:

```bash
# Upload to PyPI (requires PyPI credentials)
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

For first-time releases, it's recommended to test on TestPyPI first:

```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

### Local Cache

The library implements a local caching mechanism to improve data loading performance:
- Cache location: `~/.alpha_isnow_cache/`
- Cache format: Parquet files named as `{repo_name}_{month}.parquet`
- Cache validity: 24 hours
- Performance: Loading from cache is typically 100x faster than loading from R2

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_loader.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v tests/test_loader.py
```

### Code Quality

The project follows Python best practices:
- Code formatting with black
- Import sorting with isort
- Type checking with mypy
- Code quality checks with flake8

All code changes should pass these checks before being committed.
