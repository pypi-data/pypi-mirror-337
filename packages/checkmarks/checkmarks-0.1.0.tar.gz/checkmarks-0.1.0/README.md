# Checkmarks

A simple command-line tool to check the progress of tasks in a Markdown checklist. It scans a `.md` file for checklist items (of the form `- [ ]` and `- [x]`) and displays a progress bar.

## Features

- Identifies completed (`- [x]`) and pending (`- [ ]`) tasks in a Markdown file.
- Calculates the number of tasks done vs. total tasks.
- Optionally displays the title from the first `# Heading` in the file.
- Shows a handy progress bar with completion percentage.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.


## Usage

```bash
python checkmarks.py /path/to/your_checklist.md
```

## Example

Suppose you have a file named todo.md with the following content:
```markdown
# My Todo List

- [ ] Buy groceries
- [x] Write blog post
- [ ] Go running
```

Running python checkmarks.py todo.md will produce output like:
```
ðŸ“Š Progress for:
My Todo List
[â–ˆ-------] 1/3 tasks completed (33.3%)
```
