           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Multilingual ROUGE Scoring

This is a port of [XL-Sum](https://github.com/csebuetnlp/xl-sum) repository as a simple utility to utilize the multilingual RougeL utility for [MIRAGE-Bench](https://github.com/vectara/mirage-bench), with the following changes:

1. Added [multilingual_rouge/bengali_stemmer](multilingual_rouge/bengali_stemmer/) from [bengali-stemmer](https://github.com/abhik1505040/bengali-stemmer) repository as it was not available in PyPI.

> **I do not own the codebase so any questions must be redirected to [XL-Sum](https://github.com/csebuetnlp/xl-sum) repository.**

## Installation

To install this library, please use the following:

```bash
python -m unidic download # for japanese segmentation
pip install -U multilingual-rouge
```
Alternatively to install from source:

```bash
python -m unidic download # for japanese segmentation
pip install -e .
```

## Overview

ROUGE is the de facto evaluation metric used for text summarization. However, it was designed specifically for evaluating English texts. Due to the nature of the metric, scores are heavily dependent on text tokenization / stemming / unnecessary character removal, etc. This repo tries to address these issues by adding the following main features using an adaptation of [rouge-score: Google's rouge implementation](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rouge).

* Enables multilingual ROUGE scoring by making use of popular word segmentation / stemming algorithms for various languages.
* Removes only punctuation characters according to unicode data tables as part of text normalization. This enables basic rouge scoring even with the absence of a segmenter / stemmer for any language.
* Provides an easy to use interface for using custom tokenization / stemming implementations.
  
### Supported language names for stemming
`bengali`, `hindi`, `turkish`, `arabic`, `danish`, `dutch`, `english`, `finnish`, `french`, `german`, `hungarian`, `italian`, `norwegian`, `portuguese`, `romanian`, `russian`, `spanish`, `swedish`

### Supported language names for word segmentation
`chinese`, `thai`, `japanese`, `burmese`

## Setup
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m unidic download # for japanese segmentation
pip3 install --upgrade ./
```

## Example Usage

### Using CLI
```bash
python -m rouge_score.rouge \
    --target_filepattern=*.targets \
    --prediction_filepattern=*.decodes \
    --output_filename=scores.csv \
    --use_stemmer=true \ # optional
    --lang="bengali" # optional
```


### Using python

* **Default usage**


```python
from multilingual_rouge import rouge_scorer

scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)
scores = scorer.score('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog',
                      'The quick brown dog jumps on the log.')
```
* **With provided language**
  
```python
from multilingual_rouge import rouge_scorer

scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True, lang="bengali")
scores = scorer.score('তোমার সাথে দেখা হয়ে ভালো লাগলো।',
                      'আপনার সাথে দেখা হয়ে ভালো লাগলো।')
```

* **With your own stemming / word segmentation implementation**
  
    Custom `stemmer`/ `tokenizer` implementations must be `callable` objects, i.e. functions or classes with `__call__` method implemented. If `lang` is also given, user provided implementations take precedence over the library provided ones.

```python
from multilingual_rouge import rouge_scorer

# example with custom stemming
class DummyStemmer(object):
    def __call__(self, token):
        stem = ""
        # your stemmer implementation
        return stem

# example with custom segmenter/tokenizer
def dummy_tokenize(text):
    tokens = []
    # your tokenizer implementation
    return tokens

scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True, 
                                    callable_stemmer=DummyStemmer(),
                                    callable_tokenizer=dummy_tokenize)
scores = scorer.score('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog',
                      'The quick brown dog jumps on the log.')
                      
```

* To see list of all available keyword arguments and reference stemmer and segmenter implementations refer to [rouge_scorer.py](multilingual_rouge/rouge_scorer.py), [stemmers.py](multilingual_rouge/stemmers.py) and [tokenizers.py](multilingual_rouge/tokenizers.py)
