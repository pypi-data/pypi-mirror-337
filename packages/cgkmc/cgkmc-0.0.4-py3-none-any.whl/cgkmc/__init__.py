# Examples

## üì¶ Simple cubic growth

Below is an example of the growth of a small simple cubic lattice, printing a LAMMPS-style dump string

```py
.. include:: ../examples/simple_cubic.py
```

## ‚öõ Visualizing with OVITO

WIP: Include OVITO visualization screenshots

```py
.. include:: ../examples/ovito_visualization.py
```

## üìù Using a logger

Below is an example of using a logger to grab information from the simulation. `cgkmc` uses Python's native `logging`
library, so one can use a `logging` config to grab simulation information.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/using_logger.py
```
