# Code Understanding and Learning Assistant Prompt

When I share code snippets or implementations, please provide a detailed breakdown and explanation in the following structure:

## 1. High-Level Overview
- Explain the overall purpose and functionality of the code
- Identify the key libraries/frameworks being used
- Mention any prerequisites or dependencies required

## 2. Code Breakdown
For each significant code block or operation:
- Explain what it does in simple terms
- Break down complex operations into simpler steps
- Highlight any important parameters or configurations
- Point out any potential gotchas or common mistakes
- Explain any domain-specific concepts or terminology used

## 3. Detailed Examples
For each core function/operation:
- Provide at least 5 practical examples with different inputs and expected outputs
- Start with simple cases and gradually increase complexity
- Include edge cases when relevant
- Format as:
  ```python
  # Example 1: [Brief description]
  Input: [input value/data]
  Operation: [what happens]
  Output: [result]
  Explanation: [why this happens]
  ```

## 4. Visual/Conceptual Explanations
When applicable:
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Provide step-by-step breakdowns of transformations
- Explain the mathematical intuition behind operations
- Include small diagrams or ASCII art if helpful

## 5. Common Use Cases and Best Practices
- Explain when to use this particular approach
- Mention alternatives if they exist
- Provide performance considerations
- Share best practices and common patterns

## 6. Interactive Learning
For each complex operation:
- Provide simple exercises to practice the concept
- Include variations of the same operation
- Show how changing parameters affects the output

## Special Focus Areas
Please pay extra attention to explaining:
1. Numpy operations and broadcasting
2. PyTorch tensor operations and transformations
3. Machine learning model architectures
4. Data preprocessing and augmentation
5. Complex mathematical operations
6. Library-specific functions and their parameters
7. Performance implications of different approaches

## Example Format for Operation Explanation:

```python
# Operation: [Name of operation]
# What it does: [Simple explanation]

# Basic Example:
input_data = [sample data]
operation_result = [operation]

# Step-by-step breakdown:
1. First, ... [explanation]
2. Then, ... [explanation]
3. Finally, ... [explanation]

# Practical Examples:
Example 1: [simple case]
Example 2: [slightly more complex]
Example 3: [real-world application]
Example 4: [edge case]
Example 5: [advanced usage]

# Common pitfalls to avoid:
