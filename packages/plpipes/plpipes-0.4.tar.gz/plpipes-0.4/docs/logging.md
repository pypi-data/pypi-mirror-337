# Logging

Python standard logging framework is instantiated by the framework and
can be used directly from actions code.

If you need some particular configuration not yet supported, just ask
for it!

Also, take into account that some python frameworks (for instance,
Tensorflow or OpenVINO) unconditionally change or overload python
logging on its own.

## Automatic file logging

After initialization `plpipes` automatically creates a new file logger
which saves a copy of the log in the `logs` directory. Also, on
operating systems supporting symbolic links, it also creates a link
named `logs\last_log.txt`.
