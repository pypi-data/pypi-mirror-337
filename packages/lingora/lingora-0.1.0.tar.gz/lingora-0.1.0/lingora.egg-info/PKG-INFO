# Lingora

A command-line utility for translating UI string JSON files for [i18n]() using AI services through a plugin architecture, with a web-based reviewer interface.

## Features

- Translate JSON UI string files to any supported language
- Plugin-based architecture for different AI translation services
- Currently supports OpenAI's GPT models and includes a simulator plugin for testing
- Preserves JSON structure and folder hierarchy
- Progress tracking during translation
- Web-based reviewer interface for comparing and editing translations
- Supports recursive directory scanning for JSON files

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

For the OpenAI plugin, create a `.env` file in the project root with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # Optional, defaults to gpt-3.5-turbo
```

## Usage

### Translation

```bash
python lingora translate en de --input-dir ./locales/en --plugin-name openai
```

This will:
1. Read all JSON files from the input directory
2. Generate an intermediate XML representation
3. Translate the content to German
4. Save the translated files in `output/de/` maintaining the original directory structure

### Launch Translation Reviewer

```bash
python lingora reviewer ./locales/en ./output/de
```

This launches a web-based interface for:
- Comparing source and translated strings
- Editing translations
- Saving changes directly to the target files

### List Available Plugins

```bash
python lingora list-plugins
```

## Plugin System

The tool uses a plugin architecture to support different AI translation services. Each plugin must implement the `TranslationPlugin` interface defined in `plugins/base.py`.

### Creating a New Plugin

1. Create a new file in the `plugins` directory
2. Implement the `TranslationPlugin` interface
3. Register your plugin in `plugins/__init__.py`

Example plugin structure:
```python
from .base import TranslationPlugin

class MyTranslationPlugin(TranslationPlugin):
    def translate(self, text: str, target_lang: str) -> str:
        # Implement translation logic
        pass
    
    def get_name(self) -> str:
        return "my_plugin"
    
    def get_description(self) -> str:
        return "Description of my plugin"
    
    def is_configured(self) -> bool:
        return True  # Check if plugin is properly configured
```

## Declarations

### Credits

#### Artificial Intelligence

- Python code for translation motor regarding _i811_ JavaScript library was almost entirely done by [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) via extremely descriptive prompts [as an experiment].
- The name was chosen among recommendations in a brainstorming session by [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) [as an experiment].
