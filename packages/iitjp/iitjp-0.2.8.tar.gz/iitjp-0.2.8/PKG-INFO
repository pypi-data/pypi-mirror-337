# IITJP - Interactive Teacher for Statistics

A Python package that provides an interactive virtual teacher named RajLaxmi for learning foundations of statistics. This package includes audio-visual interactions to enhance the learning experience.

## Features

- Interactive virtual teacher with voice
- Quiz functionality with randomized questions
- Clean, text-based interface with audio support
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No external dependencies required

## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install iitjp
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import iitjp

# Start with a greeting
iitjp.mam.greetings()

# Take a quiz
iitjp.mam.quiz()

# Say goodbye
iitjp.mam.thanks()
```

### Command-line Interface

You can also use the package from the command line:

```bash
# Show greeting
iitjp greetings

# Start a quiz
iitjp quiz

# Show farewell message
iitjp thanks
```

### Silent Mode

If you want to disable audio playback:

```python
import iitjp

# Enable silent mode (no audio)
iitjp.enable_silent_mode(True)

# Now use the package as usual
iitjp.mam.greetings()
```

### Faster Text Display

To disable the typing effect and show text instantly:

```python
import iitjp

# Disable typing effect
iitjp.enable_typing_effect(False)

# Now text will appear instantly
iitjp.mam.greetings()
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter audio playback issues:

1. Check your system's audio settings to ensure it's properly configured.
2. Try using silent mode if audio is not essential:
   ```python
   import iitjp
   iitjp.enable_silent_mode(True)
   ```
