# lqrax
JAX-enabled continuous-time LQR solver.

This repo is under active development.

## Install

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install JAX before installing this package.

To install: `pip install lqrax`

## Usage

There are two modules: `LQR` and `iLQR`,

The `LQR` module solves the following time-varying LQR problem:

$$
\int_0^T \Big[ (x(t)-\bar{x}(t))^\top Q (x(t)-\bar{x}(t)) + u(t)^\top R u(t) \Big] dt \\
\text{s.t. } \dot{x}(t) = A(t) x(t) + B(t) u(t), \quad x(0) = x_0
$$

An jupyter notebook example for the `LQR` module is provided [here](examples/lqr_example.ipynb). You can open it in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MaxMSun/lqrax/blob/main/examples/lqr_example.ipynb).

The `iLQR` module solves a different time-varying iLQR problem:

$$
\int_0^T \Big[ z(t)^\top Q z(t) + v(t)^\top R v(t) + z(t)^\top a(t) + v(t)^\top b(t) \Big] dt \\
\text{s.t. } \dot{z}(t) = A(t) z(t) + B(t) v(t), \quad z(0) = 0
$$

This formulation is often used as the sub-problem for iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) to calculate the steepest descent direction on the control, where the $z(t)$ and $v(t)$ are perturbations on the system's state and control, and $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are the linearized system dynamics on the current system trajectory. 

An jupyter notebook example for the `iLQR` module is provided [here](examples/ilqr_example.ipynb). You can open it in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MaxMSun/lqrax/blob/main/examples/ilqr_example.ipynb).
