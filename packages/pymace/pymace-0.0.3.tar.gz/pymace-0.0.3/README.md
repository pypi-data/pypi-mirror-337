MACE is a tool written by the Akamodell Stuttgart for evaluating and calculating self build and designed model aircraft for private use and competitions like [ACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Cargo_Challenge).

It is currently under heavy construction. Don't expect anything to work. Functions may be removed, added and completly changed.
