# UnderDoc Python SDK

Python SDK for UnderDoc Document Understanding Platform.

## What is UnderDoc?

UnderDoc is a simple, easy to use and cost effective document understanding platform.

With the latest GenAI technologies, many LLMs can now accept multi-modal inputs (e.g. images) and produce structured output base user instructions and the content/layout appeared on images.

Our mission is to leverage these exciting technologies to re-imagine how document understanding can be done.

* Our first service is an API SaaS that can use to extract structured data from any expense images (e.g. invoice, receipt, demand notes, etc.)
* We also provide professional services for customers who want to extract structured data from their documents and images
* Our focus is in Asia market and we test our platform with a combination of English and Asian (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, etc.) languages
