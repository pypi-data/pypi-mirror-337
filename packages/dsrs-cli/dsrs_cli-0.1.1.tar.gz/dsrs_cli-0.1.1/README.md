## Installation

To install, just run:
```bash
pip install dsrs-cli
```



## Configuration                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                         
The script needs your API Key and the Base URL for the AI service.                                                         
                                                                                                                         
*   **Using `.env` file (Recommended):**                                                                                   
  *   Create a file named `.env` in the same directory where you run the script (or where `dsrs_cli.py` is located if    
installing).                                                                                                               
  *   Add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your actual credentials:                                  
      ```dotenv                                                                                                          
      OPENAI_API_KEY=...
      BASE_URL=...
      ```                                                                                                                
  *   When you run the script, choose 'y' when asked "Load API Key and Base URL from .env file?".                        
                                                                                                                         
*   **Manual Input:**                                                                                                      
  *   If you don't use a `.env` file or it's missing credentials, the script will prompt you to enter the API Key        
(hidden) and Base URL securely when it starts.                                                                             
                                                                                                                         
## Usage
