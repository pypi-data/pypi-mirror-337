    :func:`~circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_weights` now
    returns a mixture of exact and sampled weights when appropriate.
    Specifically, it exactly evaluates all weights greater than or
    equal to ``1 / num_samples`` and samples from the remaining
    weights (ones which are below this threshold).  Previously, this
    function would only return exact weights if *all* weights were
    greater than or equal to ``1 / num_samples``; otherwise, all
    weights were sampled.  The new behavior is expected to improve
    performance on non-uniform quasi-probability decompositions,
    e.g. for cut instantiations of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXXGate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RYYGate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RZZGate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CRXGate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CRYGate`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CRZGate` away from
    :math:`\theta=\pi/2`.

    :func:`~circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_samples` has
    been renamed to
    :func:`~circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_weights`.  The
    original name will be removed no sooner than version 0.4 of the
    Circuit Knitting Toolbox.
