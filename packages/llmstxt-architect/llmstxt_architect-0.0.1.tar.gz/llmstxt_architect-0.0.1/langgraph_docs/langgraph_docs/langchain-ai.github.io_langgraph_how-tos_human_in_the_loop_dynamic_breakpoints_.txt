[How to add dynamic breakpoints with NodeInterrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/dynamic_breakpoints/): LLM should read this page when learning to implement dynamic breakpoints in LangGraph, needing to add human-in-the-loop capabilities, or troubleshooting NodeInterrupt functionality. This guide explains how to use NodeInterrupt in LangGraph to dynamically pause workflow execution based on conditions within a node, allowing for human intervention before proceeding. It covers creating conditional interrupts, resuming execution after interrupts, and updating graph state.
