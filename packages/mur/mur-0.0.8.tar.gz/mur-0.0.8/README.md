# mur
A simple CLI to manage tools on your MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. 

## Install

```bash
pip install mur 
```

## Quickstart

- Host your own MCP with [capsule](https://github.com/murmur-nexus/capsule)
- [Find some tools](https://artifacts.murmur.nexus) or [build your own](https://murmur-nexus.github.io/murmur/how-to/create-a-tool/)
- Manage tools using `mur` commands

## Commands

### `mur install`

Install one or more tools into your MCP

```bash
mur install TOOL --host HOST
```

- `TOOL`: Name of the tool or toolkit to install e.g. [get_weather](https://artifacts.murmur.nexus/ewg/get_weather)
- `HOST`: Host URL from where you want to install e.g. `http://localhost:8000`

### `mur uninstall`

Uninstall one or more tools from your MCP

```bash
mur uninstall TOOL --host HOST
```

- `TOOL`: Name of the tool or toolkit to uninstall e.g. [get_weather](https://artifacts.murmur.nexus/ewg/get_weather)
- `HOST`: Host URL from where you want to uninstall e.g. `http://localhost:8000`

### `mur list`

List installed tools on your MCP

```bash
mur list --host HOST
```

- `HOST`: Host URL from where you want to list tools e.g. `http://localhost:8000`

### `mur config set`

Set a configuration for host.

```bash
mur config set public host HOST
```

- `HOST`: Host URL from where you want to install e.g. `http://localhost:8000`

This allows you to (un)install and list tools without having to specify the host every time. E.g. `mur install TOOL --host` will point to the configured HOST value. Not specifying a host will install the tool in your local python environment under the [murmur](https://github.com/murmur-nexus/murmur) namespace.
