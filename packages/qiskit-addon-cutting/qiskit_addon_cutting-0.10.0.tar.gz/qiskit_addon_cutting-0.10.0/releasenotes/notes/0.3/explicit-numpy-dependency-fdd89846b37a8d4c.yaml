    Numpy 1.23.0 or later is now required.  The :func:`~numpy.kron`
    method in earlier versions `has known performance issues
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/pull/70#issuecomment-1500514513>`__,
    and this method is used heavily by the CutQC wire cutting module.
