prelude: |
  The primary purpose of this release is to swap the order of the
  classical registers in the circuits generated the
  :mod:`circuit_knitting.cutting` module.  With this change,
  ``"observable_measurements"`` now comes before
  ``"qpd_measurements"``, and there is no longer a need to insert
  ``num_qpd_bits`` into the result metadata by hand.
