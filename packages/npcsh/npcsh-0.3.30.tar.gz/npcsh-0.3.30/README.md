# npcsh


- `npcsh` is a python-based AI Agent framework designed to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agents into one's daily workflow by making them available and easily configurable through a command line shell as well as an extensible python library.

- **Smart Interpreter**: `npcsh` leverages the power of LLMs to understand your natural language commands and questions, executing tasks, answering queries, and providing relevant information from local files and the web.

- **Macros**: `npcsh` provides macros to accomplish common tasks with LLMs like voice control (`/whisper`), image generation (`/vixynt`), screenshot capture and analysis (`/ots`), one-shot questions (`/sample`), computer use (`/plonk`),  retrieval augmented generation (`/rag`), search (`/search`) and more. Users can also build their own tools and call them like macros from the shell.


- **NPC-Driven Interactions**: `npcsh` allows users to take advantage of agents (i.e. NPCs) through a managed system. Users build a directory of NPCs and associated tools that can be used to accomplish complex tasks and workflows. NPCs can be tailored to specific tasks and have unique personalities, directives, and tools. Users can combine NPCs and tools in assembly line like workflows or use them in SQL-style models.

* **Extensible with Python:**  `npcsh`'s python package provides useful functions for interacting with LLMs, including explicit coverage for popular providers like ollama, anthropic, openai, gemini, deepseek, and openai-like providers. Each macro has a corresponding function and these can be used in python scripts. `npcsh`'s functions are purpose-built to simplify NPC interactions but NPCs are not required for them to work if you don't see the need.

* **Simple, Powerful CLI:**  Use the `npc` CLI commands to run `npcsh` macros or commands from one's regular shell. Set up a flask server so you can expose your NPC team for use as a backend service. You can also use the `npc` CLI to run SQL models defined in your project, execute assembly lines, and verify the integrity of your NPC team's interrelations. `npcsh`'s NPCs take advantage of jinja templating to reference other NPCs and tools in their properties, and the `npc` CLI can be used to verify these references.

* **Powerful Tool integrations:** `npcsh` has built-in tools for users to have agents execute code, analyze data, generate images, search the web, and more. Tools can be defined in YAML files as part of project-specific `npc_team`s or in the global `~/.npcsh/npc_team` directory or simply in python scripts. Once compiled, the tools can be used as macros in the `npc` cli as well as `/{tool_name}` commands in the `npcsh` shell.

## TLDR Cheat Sheet
Users can take advantage of `npcsh` through its custom shell or through a command-line interface (CLI) tool. Below is a cheat sheet that shows how to use `npcsh` commands in both the shell and the CLI. For the npcsh commands to work, one must activate `npcsh` by typing it in a shell.

| Task | npc CLI | npcsh |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Ask a generic question | npc 'prompt' | 'prompt' |
| Compile an NPC | npc compile /path/to/npc.npc | /compile /path/to/npc.npc |
| Computer use | npc plonk -n 'npc_name' -sp 'task for plonk to carry out '| /plonk -n 'npc_name' -sp 'task for plonk to carry out ' |
| Conjure an NPC team from context and templates | npc init -t 'template1, template2' -ctx 'context'   | /conjure  -t 'template1, 'template2' -ctx 'context'  |
| Enter a chat with an NPC (NPC needs to be compiled first) | npc npc_name | /npc_name |
| Generate image    | npc vixynt 'prompt'  | /vixynt prompt   |
| Get a sample LLM response  | npc sample 'prompt'   | /sample prompt for llm  |
| Invoke a tool  | npc tool {tool_name} -args --flags | /tool_name -args --flags |
| Search locally | npc tool local_search -args --flags | /local_search -args --flags |
| Search for a term in the npcsh_db only in conversations with a specific npc | npc rag -n 'npc_name' -f 'filename' -q 'query' | /rag -n 'npc_name' -f 'filename' -q 'query' |
| Search the web | npc search -p provider 'query' | /search -p provider 'query' |
| Serve an NPC team | npc serve --port 5337 --cors='http://localhost:5137/' | /serve --port 5337 --cors='http://localhost:5137/' |
| Screenshot analysis  | npc ots |  /ots  |
| Voice Chat    | npc whisper 'npc_name'   | /whisper   |


## Python Examples
Integrate npcsh into your Python projects for additional flexibility. Below are a few examples of how to use the library programmatically.



### Example 1: Creating and Using an NPC
This example shows how to create and initialize an NPC and use it to answer a question.
```bash
import sqlite3
from npcsh.npc_compiler import NPC

# Set up database connection
db_path = '~/npcsh_history.db'
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)

# Load NPC from a file
npc = NPC(
          name='Simon Bolivar',
          db_conn=conn,
          primary_directive='Liberate South America from the Spanish Royalists.',
          model='gpt-4o-mini',
          provider='openai',
          )

response = npc.get_llm_response("What is the most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains?")
print(response['response'])
```
```bash
'The most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains for the cause of liberation in South America would be the region of Quito in present-day Ecuador. This area is strategically significant due to its location and access to key trade routes. It also acts as a vital link between the northern and southern parts of the continent, influencing both military movements and the morale of the independence struggle. Retaining control over Quito would bolster efforts to unite various factions in the fight against Spanish colonial rule across the Andean states.'
```
### Example 2: Using an NPC to Analyze Data
This example shows how to use an NPC to perform data analysis on a DataFrame using LLM commands.
```bash
from npcsh.npc_compiler import NPC
import sqlite3
import os
# Set up database connection
db_path = '~/npcsh_history.db'
conn = sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser(db_path))

# make a table to put into npcsh_history.db or change this example to use an existing table in a database you have
import pandas as pd
data = {
        'customer_feedback': ['The product is great!', 'The service was terrible.', 'I love the new feature.'],
        'customer_id': [1, 2, 3],
        'customer_rating': [5, 1, 3],
        'timestamp': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03']
        }


df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_sql('customer_feedback', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)


npc = NPC(
          name='Felix',
          db_conn=conn,
          primary_directive='Analyze customer feedback for sentiment.',
          model='gpt-4o-mini',
          provider='openai',
          )
response = npc.analyze_db_data('Provide a detailed report on the data contained in the `customer_feedback` table?')


```


### Example 3: Creating and Using a Tool
You can define a tool and execute it from within your Python script.
Here we'll create a tool that will take in a pdf file, extract the text, and then answer a user request about the text.

```bash
from npcsh.npc_compiler import Tool, NPC
import sqlite3
import os

from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

# Create a proper Jinja environment
jinja_env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('.'))


tool_data = {
    "tool_name": "pdf_analyzer",
    "inputs": ["request", "file"],
    "steps": [{  # Make this a list with one dict inside
        "engine": "python",
        "code": """
try:
    import fitz  # PyMuPDF

    shared_context = {}
    shared_context['inputs'] = '{{request}}'

    pdf_path = '{{file}}'



    # Open the PDF
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""

    # Extract text from each page
    for page_num in range(len(doc)):
        page = doc[page_num]
        text += page.get_text()

    # Close the document
    doc.close()

    print(f"Extracted text length: {len(text)}")
    if len(text) > 100:
        print(f"First 100 characters: {text[:100]}...")

    shared_context['extracted_text'] = text
    print("Text extraction completed successfully")

except Exception as e:
    error_msg = f"Error processing PDF: {str(e)}"
    print(error_msg)
    shared_context['extracted_text'] = f"Error: {error_msg}"
"""
    },
     {
        "engine": "natural",
        "code": """
{% if shared_context and shared_context.extracted_text %}
{% if shared_context.extracted_text.startswith('Error:') %}
{{ shared_context.extracted_text }}
{% else %}
Here is the text extracted from the PDF:

{{ shared_context.extracted_text }}

Please provide a response to user request: {{ request }} using the information extracted above.
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Error: No text was extracted from the PDF.
{% endif %}
"""
    },]
    }

# Instantiate the tool
tool = Tool(tool_data)

# Create an NPC instance
npc = NPC(
    name='starlana',
    primary_directive='Analyze text from Astrophysics papers with a keen attention to theoretical machinations and mechanisms.',
    model = 'llama3.2',
    provider='ollama',
    db_conn=sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser('~/npcsh_database.db'))
)

# Define input values dictionary
input_values = {
    "request": "what is the point of the yuan and narayanan work?",
    "file": os.path.abspath("test_data/yuan2004.pdf")
}

print(f"Attempting to read file: {input_values['file']}")
print(f"File exists: {os.path.exists(input_values['file'])}")

# Execute the tool
output = tool.execute(input_values, npc.tools_dict, jinja_env, 'Sample Command',model=npc.model, provider=npc.provider,  npc=npc)

print('Tool Output:', output)
```

### Example 4: Orchestrating a team



```python

python-tkinter (pyautogui)

## Startup Configuration and Project Structure
After it has been pip installed, `npcsh` can be used as a command line tool. Start it by typing:
```bash
npcsh
```
When initialized, `npcsh` will generate a .npcshrc file in your home directory that stores your npcsh settings.
Here is an example of what the .npcshrc file might look like after this has been run.
```bash
# NPCSH Configuration File
export NPCSH_INITIALIZED=1
export NPCSH_CHAT_PROVIDER='ollama'
export NPCSH_CHAT_MODEL='llama3.2'
export NPCSH_DB_PATH='~/npcsh_history.db'
```
`npcsh` also comes with a set of tools and NPCs that are used in processing. It will generate a folder at ~/.npcsh/ that contains the tools and NPCs that are used in the shell and these will be used in the absence of other project-specific ones. Additionally, `npcsh` records interactions and compiled information about npcs within a local SQLite database at the path specified in the .npcshrc file. This will default to ~/npcsh_history.db if not specified. When the data mode is used to load or analyze data in CSVs or PDFs, these data will be stored in the same database for future reference.

The installer will automatically add this file to your shell config, but if it does not do so successfully for whatever reason you can add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

```bash
# Source NPCSH configuration
if [ -f ~/.npcshrc ]; then
    . ~/.npcshrc
fi
```

We support inference via `openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`,`gemini`, `deepseek`,  and `openai-like` APIs. The default provider must be one of `['openai','anthropic','ollama', 'gemini', 'deepseek', 'openai-like']` and the model must be one available from those providers.

To use tools that require API keys, create an `.env` file up in the folder where you are working or place relevant API keys as env variables in your ~/.npcshrc. If you already have these API keys set in a ~/.bashrc or a ~/.zshrc or similar files, you need not additionally add them to ~/.npcshrc or to an `.env` file. Here is an example of what an `.env` file might look like:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_deepseek_key'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_key'
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY='your_perplexity_key'
```


 Individual npcs can also be set to use different models and providers by setting the `model` and `provider` keys in the npc files.
 Once initialized and set up, you will find the following in your ~/.npcsh directory:
```bash
~/.npcsh/
├── npc_team/           # Global NPCs
│   ├── tools/          # Global tools
│   └── assembly_lines/ # Workflow pipelines

```
For cases where you wish to set up a project specific set of NPCs, tools, and assembly lines, add a `npc_team` directory to your project and `npcsh` should be able to pick up on its presence, like so:
```bash
./npc_team/            # Project-specific NPCs
├── tools/             # Project tools #example tool next
│   └── example.tool
└── assembly_lines/    # Project workflows
    └── example.pipe
└── models/    # Project workflows
    └── example.model
└── example1.npc        # Example NPC
└── example2.npc        # Example NPC
└── example1.ctx        # Example NPC
└── example2.ctx        # Example NPC

```

## IMPORTANT: migrations and deprecations

### v0.3.4
-In v0.3.4, the structure for tools was adjusted. If you have made custom tools please refer to the structure within npc_compiler to ensure that they are in the correct format. Otherwise, do the following
```bash
rm ~/.npcsh/npc_team/tools/*.tool
```
and then
```bash
npcsh
```
and the updated tools will be copied over into the correct location.

### v0.3.5
-Version 0.3.5 included a complete overhaul and refactoring of the llm_funcs module. This was done to make it not as horribly long and to make it easier to add new models and providers


-in version 0.3.5, a change was introduced to the database schema for messages to add npcs, models, providers, and associated attachments to data. If you have used `npcsh` before this version, you will need to run this migration script to update your database schema:   [migrate_conversation_history_v0.3.5.py](https://github.com/cagostino/npcsh/blob/cfb9dc226e227b3e888f3abab53585693e77f43d/npcsh/migrations/migrate_conversation_history_%3Cv0.3.4-%3Ev0.3.5.py)

-additionally, NPCSH_MODEL and NPCSH_PROVIDER have been renamed to NPCSH_CHAT_MODEL and NPCSH_CHAT_PROVIDER
to provide a more consistent naming scheme now that we have additionally introduced `NPCSH_VISION_MODEL` and `NPCSH_VISION_PROVIDER`, `NPCSH_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `NPCSH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `NPCSH_REASONING_MODEL`, `NPCSH_REASONING_PROVIDER`, `NPCSH_IMAGE_GEN_MODEL`, and `NPCSH_IMAGE_GEN_PROVIDER`.
- In addition, we have added NPCSH_API_URL to better accommodate openai-like apis that require a specific url to be set as well as `NPCSH_STREAM_OUTPUT` to indicate whether or not to use streaming in one's responses. It will be set to 0 (false) by default as it has only been tested  and verified for a small subset of the models and providers we have available (openai, anthropic, and ollama). If you try it and run into issues, please post them here so we can correct them as soon as possible !


## npcsh usage
In the `npcsh` shell, users can ask LLMs questions, have LLMLs execute commands or use tools, or utilize macros that provide additional functionality. When a user does not invoke a specific macro, the shell will automatically decide which tool to use based on the user's input. Here are some examples of things one might ask the npcsh shell.

Here are some examples of how you can use npcsh
```npcsh
npcsh>Who was Simon Bolivar?

Simón Bolívar, often referred to as "El Libertador," was a Venezuelan military and political leader who played a key role in the Latin American wars of independence against Spanish
colonial rule in the early 19th century. He was born on July 24, 1783, in Caracas, Venezuela, into a wealthy Creole family.
Bolívar's vision extended beyond merely liberating territories; he aspired to unify the newly independent nations of South America into a single federation, which he called "Gran
Colombia," consisting of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. He was known for his exceptional military strategies and leadership, which led to successful campaigns in
various regions, including the battles of Boyacá, Carabobo, and Ayacucho.
He faced numerous challenges, including political fragmentation, regional rivalries, and personal betrayals. Despite his initial successes, the unity he sought for Latin America proved
difficult to achieve, and Gran Colombia eventually disintegrated in the early 1830s.
Bolívar's influence and legacy extend far beyond his lifetime. He is celebrated in various countries across Latin America as a national hero and symbol of independence. His thoughts on
liberty, governance, and social issues continue to inspire movements for democracy and social justice in the region. Simón Bolívar died on December 17, 1830, but remains a pivotal figure
in the history of Latin America.

```npcsh
npcsh> What is the capital of France?
The capital of France is Paris. It is the largest city in the country and is known for its rich history, art, culture, and architecture, including famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum.
```

```npcsh

Additional input needed: The user did not specify their favorite city, which is necessary to generate a relevant joke.
Please tell me your favorite city so I can share a joke about it!: boston

Sure! Here's a joke about Boston:
Why do Bostonians like to play hide and seek?
Because good luck hiding when everyone yells, "Wicked awesome, ya gotta be here!"

In the below example, the code that was open was the screen capture analysis tool itself.
```npcsh
npcsh>  Can you explain what the code does in the currently open VS code window?

handle_tool_call invoked with tool_name: screen_capture_analysis_tool

Screenshot saved as screenshot_20241223_225815.png

The code in the visible section of your VS Code window appears to be a script for capturing and analyzing screenshots. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

 1 Import Necessary Libraries: It imports required libraries like system, datetime, and pyautogui, which are essential for capturing screenshots and handling date-time operations.

 2 Capture the Screen: The code captures the current screen using pyautogui.screenshot(), taking a screenshot of the entire screen.

 3 File Management: It generates a unique filename for the screenshot using the current date and time. This ensures that each screenshot file is distinct.

 4 Save the Screenshot: The captured screenshot is saved to a file with the generated filename.

 5 Image Analysis: It likely imports a functionality (analyze_image_base) to analyze the screenshot for specific content or information.

 6 Run the Analysis: While not explicitly shown, it appears to call this analysis function to process the saved screenshot.
In summary, this code automates the process of capturing a screenshot, saving it with a unique filename, and analyzing that image for specific content or patterns.

```npcsh
npcsh> What is the biggest file in my current folder?

LLM suggests the following bash command: ls -S | head -n 1

Running command: ls -S | head -n 1

Command executed with output: image_20241111_000033.png

I ran the command ls -S | head -n 1 in your current folder. This command sorts all files by size in descending order and then selects the first entry, which represents the largest file. The result of this operation shows that the biggest file in your current folder is image_20241111_000033.png.

```

```npcsh
npcsh>What is the best way to implement a linked list in Python?

The best way to implement a linked list in Python is to define a Node class for the individual elements and a LinkedList class to manage the nodes. Here's a basic implementation:
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Store the data
        self.next = None  # Initialize the next node as None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Initialize the head of the list

    def insert(self, data):
        """Inserts a new node at the end of the linked list."""
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:  # If list is empty, set new node as head
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:  # Traverse to the last node
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node  # Link the new node

    def display(self):
        """Prints the linked list."""
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Example usage:
llist = LinkedList()
llist.insert(1)
llist.insert(2)
llist.insert(3)
llist.display()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
                                                                                            Explanation:

 1 Node Class: Represents each node in the linked list. It has two attributes: data (to store the value) and next (to point to the next node).

 2 LinkedList Class: Manages the linked list. It has a head attribute pointing to the first node.

 3 Insert Method: Adds a new node to the end of the list.

 4 Display Method: Prints the elements of the list in order.
This implementation is simple and can be extended with more methods (e.g., deletion, searching, etc.) as needed.

```

```npcsh
npcsh> In which of the files in the current directory is "Simon Bolivar" mentioned?

The user's query was about "Simon Bolivar." Based on the relevant context from the codebase, I found specific mentions and relevant information regarding Simon Bolívar in the documentation provided
in the README.md file.
From the relevant context, specifically in the section of README.md, it shared a code example that demonstrates how to load an NPC (Non-Player Character) named "Simon Bolivar" using SQLite and
answer a question about project updates. This code snippet indicates that "Simon Bolivar" is represented in the NPC system, allowing for interaction through questions to retrieve information.
Additionally, there is another passage that directly answers the query. It reads:

▌ "Simón Bolívar, often referred to as 'El Libertador,' was a Venezuelan military and political leader who played a key role in the Latin American wars of independence against Spanish colonial
▌ rule in the early 19th century."
This information highlights Bolívar's significant historical role and achievements, answering the query regarding who Simon Bolivar was, thus making it clear that he was a prominent leader in Latin
America's fight for independence.
To summarize, I arrived at this answer by examining the provided context in the README.md file that includes both the coding example that initializes an NPC named "Simon Bolivar" and a historical
overview of his contributions, which directly addresses the user's inquiry.

To determine which processes are using the most RAM on your computer, I executed the command ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10.
This command lists all running processes (ps aux), sorts them by memory usage in descending order (--sort=-%mem), and then retrieves the top 10 entries (head -n 10).
The output shows the processes currently consuming the most memory. In the results, the process using the most RAM is Vivaldi's renderer, followed by other applications such as the Elementary App Center, Ollama server, and several instances of Python related to your NPC shell.

handle_tool_call invoked with tool_name: image_generation_tool
```
![catfight](test_data/catfight.PNG)


In addition to its ability to execute one-off tasks or tool calls, npcsh also has
the ability to generate tool call sequences when asked:
```npcsh

npcsh> can you use a tool sequence to find the gdp of russia in 2024 and then to use that information to generate an image?

handle_tool_call invoked with tool_name: generic_search_tool
Tool found: generic_search_tool
handle_tool_call invoked with tool_name: image_generation_tool
Tool found: image_generation_tool

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Russia is estimated to be $8.311 trillion by the end of 2024, according to World Economics.
This figure is significantly larger than the official estimate of $5.804 trillion published by the World Bank for the end of 2023.

It seems that you've generated an image. If you have any questions or need assistance related to this image, please let me know how I can help!
```
and then the associated image :
![gdp](test_data/r8ss9a.PNG)







### Piping outputs
An important facet that makes `npcsh` so powerful is the ability to pipe outputs from one tool call to another. This allows for the chaining of commands and the creation of complex workflows. For example, you can use the output of a search to generate an image, or you can use the output of an image analysis to generate a report. Here is an example of how this might look in practice:
```npcsh
npcsh> what is the gdp of russia in 2024? | /vixynt 'generate an image that contains {0}'

### Executing Bash Commands
You can execute bash commands directly within npcsh. The LLM can also generate and execute bash commands based on your natural language requests.
For example:
```npcsh
npcsh> ls -l

npcsh> cp file1.txt file2.txt
npcsh> mv file1.txt file2.txt
npcsh> mkdir new_directory
npcsh> git status
npcsh> vim file.txt

```

### NPC CLI
When npcsh is installed, it comes with the `npc` cli as well. The `npc` cli has various command to make initializing and serving NPC projects easier.

Users can make queries like so:
```bash
$ npc 'whats the biggest filei  n my computer'
Loaded .env file from /home/caug/npcww/npcsh
action chosen: request_input
explanation given: The user needs to provide more context about their operating system or specify which directory to search for the biggest file.

Additional input needed: The user did not specify their operating system or the directory to search for the biggest file, making it unclear how to execute the command.
Please specify your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) and the directory you want to search in.: linux and root
action chosen: execute_command
explanation given: The user is asking for the biggest file on their computer, which can be accomplished with a simple bash command that searches for the largest files.
sibiji generating command
LLM suggests the following bash command: sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1
Running command: sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1
Command executed with output: 11G       /home/caug/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--state-spaces--mamba-2.8b/blobs/39911a8470a2b256016b57cc71c68e0f96751cba5b229216ab1f4f9d82096a46

I ran a command on your Linux system that searches for the largest files on your computer. The command `sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1` performs the following steps:

1. **Find Command**: It searches for all files (`-type f`) starting from the root directory (`/`).
2. **Disk Usage**: For each file found, it calculates its disk usage in a human-readable format (`du -h`).
3. **Sort**: It sorts the results in reverse order based on size (`sort -rh`), so the largest files appear first.
4. **Head**: Finally, it retrieves just the largest file using `head -n 1`.

The output indicates that the biggest file on your system is located at `/home/caug/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--state-spaces--mamba-2.8b/blobs/39911a8470a2b256016b57cc71c68e0f96751cba5b229216ab1f4f9d82096a46` and is 11GB in size.

### Serving
To serve an NPC project, first install redis-server and start it

on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server
redis-server
```

on macOS:
```bash
brew install redis
redis-server
```
Then navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npc serve
```
If you want to specify a certain port, you can do so with the `-p` flag:
```bash
npc serve -p 5337
```
or with the `--port` flag:
```bash
npc serve --port 5337

```
If you want to initialize a project based on templates and then make it available for serving, you can do so like this
```bash
npc serve -t 'sales, marketing' -ctx 'im developing a team that will focus on sales and marketing within the logging industry. I need a team that can help me with the following: - generate leads - create marketing campaigns - build a sales funnel - close deals - manage customer relationships - manage sales pipeline - manage marketing campaigns - manage marketing budget' -m llama3.2 -pr ollama
```
This will use the specified model and provider to generate a team of npcs to fit the templates and context provided.


Once the server is up and running, you can access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:5337/api/`. Here are some example curl commands to test the endpoints:

```bash
echo "Testing health endpoint..."
curl -s http://localhost:5337/api/health | jq '.'

echo -e "\nTesting execute endpoint..."
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5337/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"commandstr": "hello world", "currentPath": "~/", "conversationId": "test124"}' | jq '.'

echo -e "\nTesting conversations endpoint..."
curl -s "http://localhost:5337/api/conversations?path=/tmp" | jq '.'

echo -e "\nTesting conversation messages endpoint..."
curl -s http://localhost:5337/api/conversation/test123/messages | jq '.'
```

###

## Macros

While npcsh can decide the best option to use based on the user's input, the user can also execute certain actions with a macro. Macros are commands within the NPC shell that start with a forward slash (/) and are followed (in some cases) by the relevant arguments for those macros. Each macro is also available as a sub-program within the NPC CLI. In the following examples we demonstrate how to carry out the same operations from within npcsh and from a regular shell.


To learn about the available macros from within the shell, type:
```npcsh
npcsh> /help
```

or from bash
```bash
npc --help
#alternatively
npc -h
```

To exit the shell:
```npcsh
npcsh> /exit
```

Otherwise, here are some more detailed examples of macros that can be used in npcsh:
### Conjure (under construction)
Use the `/conjure` macro to generate an NPC, a NPC tool, an assembly line, a job, or an SQL model

```bash
npc conjure -n name -t 'templates'
```


### Data Interaction and analysis (under construction)


### Debate (under construction)
Use the `/debate` macro to have two or more NPCs debate a topic, problem, or question.

For example:
```npcsh
npcsh> /debate Should humans colonize Mars? npcs = ['sibiji', 'mark', 'ted']
```



### Notes
Jot down notes and store them within the npcsh database and in the current directory as a text file.
```npcsh
npcsh> /notes
```


### Over-the-shoulder: Screenshots and image analysis

Use the /ots macro to take a screenshot and write a prompt for an LLM to answer about the screenshot.
```npcsh
npcsh> /ots

Screenshot saved to: /home/caug/.npcsh/screenshots/screenshot_1735015011.png

Enter a prompt for the LLM about this image (or press Enter to skip): describe whats in this image

The image displays a source control graph, likely from a version control system like Git. It features a series of commits represented by colored dots connected by lines, illustrating the project's development history. Each commit message provides a brief description of the changes made, including tasks like fixing issues, merging pull requests, updating README files, and adjusting code or documentation. Notably, several commits mention specific users, particularly "Chris Agostino," indicating collaboration and contributions to the project. The graph visually represents the branching and merging of code changes.
```

In bash:
```bash
npc ots
```



Alternatively, pass an existing image in like :
```npcsh
npcsh> /ots test_data/catfight.PNG
Enter a prompt for the LLM about this image (or press Enter to skip): whats in this ?

The image features two cats, one calico and one orange tabby, playing with traditional Japanese-style toys. They are each holding sticks attached to colorful pom-pom balls, which resemble birds. The background includes stylized waves and a red sun, accentuating a vibrant, artistic style reminiscent of classic Japanese art. The playful interaction between the cats evokes a lively, whimsical scene.
```

```bash
npc ots -f test_data/catfight.PNG
```


### Plan : Schedule tasks to be run at regular intervals (under construction)
Use the /plan macro to schedule tasks to be run at regular intervals.
```npcsh
npcsh> /plan run a rag search for 'moonbeam' on the files in the current directory every 5 minutes
```

```npcsh
npcsh> /plan record the cpu usage every 5 minutes
```

```npcsh
npcsh> /plan record the apps that are using the most ram every 5 minutes
```




```bash
npc plan -f 30m -t 'task'
```

Plan will use platform-specific scheduling tools. In particular, it uses crontab on Linux and launchd on macOS and Schedule Tasks on Windows.

Implementations have been provided for Mac and Windows but only has been tested as of 3/23/2025 on Linux.



### Plonk : Computer Control
Use the /plonk macro to allow the LLM to control your computer.
```npcsh
npcsh> /plonk go to a web browser and  go to wikipedia and find out information about simon bolivar
```

```bash
npc plonk 'use a web browser to find out information about simon boliver'
```

### RAG

Use the /rag macro to perform a local rag search.
If you pass a `-f` flag with a filename or list of filenames (e.g. *.py) then it will embed the documents and perform the cosine similarity scoring.

```npcsh
npcsh> /rag -f *.py  what is the best way to implement a linked list in Python?
```

Alternatively , if you want to perform rag on your past conversations, you can do so like this:
```npcsh
npcsh> /rag  what is the best way to implement a linked list in Python?
```
and it will automatically look through the recorded conversations in the ~/npcsh_history.db


In bash:
```bash
npc rag -f *.py
```

### Rehash

Use the /rehash macro to re-send the last message to the LLM.
```npcsh
npcsh> /rehash
```

### Sample
Send a one-shot question to the LLM.
```npcsh
npcsh> /sample What is the capital of France?
```

Bash:
```bash
npc sample 'thing' -m model -p provider

```


### Search
Search can be accomplished through the `/search` macro. You can specify the provider as being "perplexity" or "duckduckgo". For the former,
you must set a perplexity api key as an environment variable as described above. The default provider is duckduckgo.

NOTE: while google is an available search engine, they recently implemented changes (early 2025) that make the python google search package no longer as reliable.
For now, we will use duckduckgo and revisit this issue when other more critical aspects are handled.


```npcsh
npcsh!> /search -p duckduckgo  who is the current us president

### Set: Changing defaults from within npcsh
Users can change the default model and provider from within npcsh by using the following commands:
```npcsh
npcsh> /set model ollama
npcsh> /set provider llama3.2
```


### Sleep : a method for creating and updating a knowledge graph (under construction)

Use the `/sleep` macro to create or update a knowledge graph. A knowledge graph is a structured representation of facts about you as a user that the NPCs can determine based on the conversations you have had with it.
```npcsh
npcsh> /sleep
```

### breathe: a method for condensing context on a regular cadence (# messages, len(context), etc) (under construction)
-every 10 messages/7500 characters, condense the conversation into lessons learned. write the lessons learned down by the np
for the day, then the npc will see the lessons they have learned that day in that folder as part of the context.



### Spool
Spool mode allows one to enter into a conversation with a specific LLM or a specific NPC.
This is used for having distinct interactions from those in the base shell and these will be separately contained.


Start the spool mode:
```npcsh
npcsh> /spool
```
Start the spool mode with a specific npc

```npcsh
npcsh> /spool npc=foreman
```

Start the spool mode with specific files in context that will be referenced through RAG searches when relevant.

```npcsh
npcsh> /spool files=[*.py,*.md] # Load specific files for context
```

Have a conversation and switch between text and voice mode by invoking `/whisper` mode from within spool mode.
```npcsh
spool> what can you tell me about green bull from one piece?

Green Bull, also known as Ryokugyu, is a character from the popular anime and manga series One Piece. He is one of the Marine Admirals and was introduced during the Wano Country arc. Here are some key points about Green
Bull:
 1 Real Name: His real name is Aramaki, but he is primarily known by his title, Green Bull (Ryokugyu in Japanese).
 2 Appearance: Green Bull has a distinct look characterized by a green military uniform, a long cape, and a
    noticeable plant-based theme, which aligns with his powers.
 3 Devil Fruit: Green Bull is a user of the Mori Mori no Mi (Forest Forest Fruit), a Logia-type Devil Fruit that
    allows him to generate and manipulate plant matter. This ability can be seen in his combat style, which utilizes
    plants to entrap and attack opponents.
 4 Role as an Admiral: As an Admiral, Green Bull holds a high-ranking position in the Marines and is
    known for his strength and authority. He is fiercely loyal to the Marine organization and its goals.
 5 Personality: Green Bull displays a laid-back attitude and often appears more relaxed compared to other Admirals.
    His personality can be somewhat ambiguous, which adds depth to his character.
 6 Involvement in the Story: Green Bull's introduction brings anticipation regarding his potential confrontations with
    key characters in the series. His role in major arcs like Wano and his interactions with the Straw Hat Pirates and
    other significant figures are crucial for the unfolding storyline.
 Overall, Green Bull is an intriguing character with unique abilities and a significant role within the One Piece universe.

You said: What do you think his greatest weakness is?


Based on what we know about Green Bull from the One Piece series, I can identify a few potential weaknesses:

1. **Extreme Laziness**:
- Green Bull is known for being incredibly lazy, often refusing to move or exert himself unnecessarily.
- This laziness could be exploited by opponents who understand how to manipulate or provoke him into action.

2. **Dependency on External Nutrition**:
- His Devil Fruit power allows him to absorb nutrients from the environment, which suggests he might become weakened in environments with limited plant life or nutrients.
- In extremely barren or non-vegetative settings, his regenerative and plant-based abilities might be significantly reduced.

3. **Pride and Marine Ideology**:
- Like many Marines, he likely has a rigid sense of justice that could be used against him strategically.
- His commitment to Marine principles might make him predictable in certain confrontational scenarios.

4. **Potential Overconfidence**:
- As an Admiral, he might underestimate opponents, especially pirates, due to his high-ranking status.
- His laid-back nature might lead him to not take threats seriously until it's too late.

The most pronounced weakness seems to be his extreme laziness, which could potentially be exploited tactically by skilled opponents who understand how to force him into action or create scenarios that challenge his passive nature.

Here are some additional details about Green Bull (Aramaki) in "One Piece":

 1 Devil Fruit Name:

 • Green Bull's Devil Fruit has been confirmed to be the Mori Mori no Mi, which is a mythical Zoan-type fruit. This allows him to utilize various forms of plant life in combat and has regenerative
   capabilities.

 2 Combat Abilities:

 • His ability to control vegetation gives him significant advantages in battle. He can generate plants to attack or defend and possibly use them for tactical advantages, such as creating barriers
   or entangling enemies.

 3 Reputation:

 • As an Admiral, Green Bull holds a position of great power and authority within the Marines. His reputation is likely formidable among pirates and other opponents.

 4 Interactions with Other Characters:

 • Green Bull's character dynamics with others in the series, particularly with fellow Marines and pirates, can provide insight into his personality and values. His interactions during missions or
   discussions about justice will reveal more about his character.

 5 Appearance and Style:

 • He has a rather unique aesthetic, characterized by his green clothing that symbolizes his connection to nature. His overall appearance contributes to his identity as a plant-based fighter.

 6 Backstory:

 • As of now, specific details about his backstory and how he rose to the rank of Admiral are not extensively explored in the series. This leaves room for further character development and
   background to be unveiled in future chapters.

 7 Ambiguous Personality:

 • While his laziness and laid-back demeanor are evident, it is possible that there are deeper layers to his character that might be revealed through his actions and motivations within the
   overarching narrative of "One Piece."

 8 Role in the Marine Organization:

 • His position as Admiral places him in direct opposition to the main pirate characters, particularly the Straw Hat crew, making him a significant figure in the ongoing conflict between pirates
   and the Marines.
As the story continues to develop, Green Bull's character may evolve and reveal more complexities, weaknesses, and relationships within the world of "One Piece."

Start the spool with a specific llm model:
```npcsh
#note this is not yet implemented
npcsh> /spool model=llama3.3
```

```bash
npc spool -n npc.npc
```

### Trigger
Use the /trigger macro to execute specific actionss based on certain conditions.

```npcsh
npcsh> /trigger watch for new PDF downloads in the ~/Downloads directory and move them
to the ~/Documents/PDFs directory . Ensure that the directory exists or create it if it does not.
```

On Linux, trigger makes use of inotify-tools to watch for file system events. On macOS, it uses fswatch, and on Windows, it uses Watch-Command.





### Vixynt: Image Generation
Image generation can be done with the /vixynt macro.

Use /vixynt like so where you can also specify the model to use with an @ reference. This @ reference will override the default model in ~/.npcshrc.

```npcsh
npcsh> /vixynt A futuristic cityscape @dall-e-3
```
![futuristic cityscape](test_data/futuristic_cityscape.PNG)

```npcsh
npcsh> /vixynt A peaceful landscape @runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
```
![peaceful landscape](test_data/peaceful_landscape_stable_diff.png)


Similarly, use vixynt with the NPC CLI from a regular shell:
```bash
$ npc --model 'dall-e-2' --provider 'openai' vixynt 'whats a french man to do in the southern bayeaux'
```




### Whisper: Voice Control
Enter into a voice-controlled mode to interact with the LLM. This mode can executet commands and use tools just like the basic npcsh shell.
```npcsh
npcsh> /whisper
```




### Compilation and NPC Interaction
Compile a specified NPC profile. This will make it available for use in npcsh interactions.
```npcsh
npcsh> /compile <npc_file>
```
You can also use `/com` as an alias for `/compile`. If no NPC file is specified, all NPCs in the npc_team directory will be compiled.

Begin a conversations with a specified NPC by referencing their name
```npcsh
npcsh> /<npc_name>:
```



## NPC Data Layer

What principally powers the capabilities of npcsh is the NPC Data Layer. In the `~/.npcsh/` directory after installation, you will find
the npc teaam with its tools, models, contexts, assembly lines, and NPCs. By making tools, NPCs, contexts, and assembly lines simple data structures with
a fixed set of parameters, we can let users define them in easy-to-read YAML files, allowing for a modular and extensible system that can be easily modified and expanded upon. Furthermore, this data layer relies heavily on jinja templating to allow for dynamic content generation and the ability to reference other NPCs, tools, and assembly lines in the system.

### Creating NPCs
NPCs are defined in YAML files within the npc_team directory. Each NPC must have a name and a primary directive. Optionally, one can specify an LLM model/provider for the NPC as well as provide an explicit list of tools and whether or not to use the globally available tools. See the data models contained in `npcsh/data_models.py` for more explicit type details on the NPC data structure.



Here is a typical NPC file:
```yaml
name: sibiji
primary_directive: You are a foundational AI assistant. Your role is to provide basic support and information. Respond to queries concisely and accurately.
tools:
  - simple data retrieval
model: llama3.2
provider: ollama
```


## Creating Tools
Tools are defined as YAMLs with `.tool` extension within the npc_team/tools directory. Each tool has a name, inputs, and consists of three distinct steps: preprocess, prompt, and postprocess. The idea here is that a tool consists of a stage where information is preprocessed and then passed to a prompt for some kind of analysis and then can be passed to another stage for postprocessing. In each of these three cases, the engine must be specified. The engine can be either "natural" for natural language processing or "python" for Python code. The code is the actual code that will be executed.

Here is an example of a tool file:
```yaml
tool_name: "screen_capture_analysis_tool"
description: Captures the whole screen and sends the image for analysis
inputs:
  - "prompt"
steps:
  - engine: "python"
    code: |
      # Capture the screen
      import pyautogui
      import datetime
      import os
      from PIL import Image
      import time
      from npcsh.image import analyze_image_base, capture_screenshot

      out = capture_screenshot(npc = npc, full = True)

      llm_response = analyze_image_base( '{{prompt}}' + "\n\nAttached is a screenshot of my screen currently. Please use this to evaluate the situation. If the user asked for you to explain what's on their screen or something similar, they are referring to the details contained within the attached image. You do not need to actually view their screen. You do not need to mention that you cannot view or interpret images directly. You only need to answer the user's request based on the attached screenshot!",
                                        out['file_path'],
                                        out['filename'],
                                        npc=npc,
                                        **out['model_kwargs'])
      # To this:
      if isinstance(llm_response, dict):
          llm_response = llm_response.get('response', 'No response from image analysis')
      else:
          llm_response = 'No response from image analysis'

```


When you have created a tool, it will be surfaced as a potential option to be used when you ask a question in the base npcsh shell. The LLM will decide if it is the best tool to use based on the user's input. Alternatively, if you'd like, you can call the tools directly, without needing to let the AI decide if it's the right one to use.

  ```npcsh
  npcsh> /screen_cap_tool <prompt>
  ```
  or
  ```npcsh
  npcsh> /sql_executor select * from conversation_history limit 1

  ```
  or
  ```npcsh
  npcsh> /calculator 5+6
  ```


## NPC Pipelines



Let's say you want to create a pipeline of steps where NPCs are used along the way. Let's initialize with a pipeline file we'll call `morning_routine.pipe`:
```yaml
steps:
  - step_name: "review_email"
    npc: "{{ ref('email_assistant') }}"
    task: "Get me up to speed on my recent emails: {{source('emails')}}."


  - step_name: "market_update"
    npc: "{{ ref('market_analyst') }}"
    task: "Give me an update on the latest events in the market: {{source('market_events')}}."

  - step_name: "summarize"
    npc: "{{ ref('sibiji') }}"
    model: llama3.2
    provider: ollama
    task: "Review the outputs from the {{review_email}} and {{market_update}} and provide me with a summary."

```
Now youll see that we reference NPCs in the pipeline file. We'll need to make sure we have each of those NPCs available.
Here is an example for the email assistant:
```yaml
name: email_assistant
primary_directive: You are an AI assistant specialized in managing and summarizing emails. You should present the information in a clear and concise manner.
model: gpt-4o-mini
provider: openai
```
Now for the marketing analyst:
```yaml
name: market_analyst
primary_directive: You are an AI assistant focused on monitoring and analyzing market trends. Provide de
model: llama3.2
provider: ollama
```
and then here is our trusty friend sibiji:
```yaml
name: sibiji
primary_directive: You are a foundational AI assistant. Your role is to provide basic support and information. Respond to queries concisely and accurately.
suggested_tools_to_use:
  - simple data retrieval
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
provider: anthropic
```
Now that we have our pipeline and NPCs defined, we also need to ensure that the source data we are referencing will be there. When we use source('market_events') and source('emails') we are asking npcsh to pull those data directly from tables in our npcsh database. For simplicity we will just make these in python to insert them for this demo:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import os

# Sample market events data
market_events_data = {
    "datetime": [
        "2023-10-15 09:00:00",
        "2023-10-16 10:30:00",
        "2023-10-17 11:45:00",
        "2023-10-18 13:15:00",
        "2023-10-19 14:30:00",
    ],
    "headline": [
        "Stock Market Rallies Amid Positive Economic Data",
        "Tech Giant Announces New Product Line",
        "Federal Reserve Hints at Interest Rate Pause",
        "Oil Prices Surge Following Supply Concerns",
        "Retail Sector Reports Record Q3 Earnings",
    ],
}

# Create a DataFrame
market_events_df = pd.DataFrame(market_events_data)

# Define database path relative to user's home directory
db_path = os.path.expanduser("~/npcsh_history.db")

# Create a connection to the SQLite database
engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{db_path}")
with engine.connect() as connection:
    # Write the data to a new table 'market_events', replacing existing data
    market_events_df.to_sql(
        "market_events", con=connection, if_exists="replace", index=False
    )

print("Market events have been added to the database.")

email_data = {
    "datetime": [
        "2023-10-10 10:00:00",
        "2023-10-11 11:00:00",
        "2023-10-12 12:00:00",
        "2023-10-13 13:00:00",
        "2023-10-14 14:00:00",
    ],
    "subject": [
        "Meeting Reminder",
        "Project Update",
        "Invoice Attached",
        "Weekly Report",
        "Holiday Notice",
    ],
    "sender": [
        "alice@example.com",
        "bob@example.com",
        "carol@example.com",
        "dave@example.com",
        "eve@example.com",
    ],
    "recipient": [
        "bob@example.com",
        "carol@example.com",
        "dave@example.com",
        "eve@example.com",
        "alice@example.com",
    ],
    "body": [
        "Don't forget the meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.",
        "The project is progressing well, see attached update.",
        "Please find your invoice attached.",
        "Here is the weekly report.",
        "The office will be closed on holidays, have a great time!",
    ],
}

# Create a DataFrame
emails_df = pd.DataFrame(email_data)

# Define database path relative to user's home directory
db_path = os.path.expanduser("~/npcsh_history.db")

# Create a connection to the SQLite database
engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{db_path}")
with engine.connect() as connection:
    # Write the data to a new table 'emails', replacing existing data
    emails_df.to_sql("emails", con=connection, if_exists="replace", index=False)

print("Sample emails have been added to the database.")

```


With these data now in place, we can proceed with running the pipeline. We can do this in npcsh by using the /compile command.




```npcsh
npcsh> /compile morning_routine.pipe
```



Alternatively we can run a pipeline like so in Python:

```bash
from npcsh.npc_compiler import PipelineRunner
import os

pipeline_runner = PipelineRunner(
    pipeline_file="morning_routine.pipe",
    npc_root_dir=os.path.abspath("./"),
    db_path="~/npcsh_history.db",
)
pipeline_runner.execute_pipeline(inputs)
```

What if you wanted to run operations on each row and some operations on all the data at once? We can do this with the pipelines as well. Here we will build a pipeline for news article analysis.
First we make the data for the pipeline that well use:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import os

# Sample data generation for news articles
news_articles_data = {
    "news_article_id": list(range(1, 21)),
    "headline": [
        "Economy sees unexpected growth in Q4",
        "New tech gadget takes the world by storm",
        "Political debate heats up over new policy",
        "Health concerns rise amid new disease outbreak",
        "Sports team secures victory in last minute",
        "New economic policy introduced by government",
        "Breakthrough in AI technology announced",
        "Political leader delivers speech on reforms",
        "Healthcare systems pushed to limits",
        "Celebrated athlete breaks world record",
        "Controversial economic measures spark debate",
        "Innovative tech startup gains traction",
        "Political scandal shakes administration",
        "Healthcare workers protest for better pay",
        "Major sports event postponed due to weather",
        "Trade tensions impact global economy",
        "Tech company accused of data breach",
        "Election results lead to political upheaval",
        "Vaccine developments offer hope amid pandemic",
        "Sports league announces return to action",
    ],
    "content": ["Article content here..." for _ in range(20)],
    "publication_date": pd.date_range(start="1/1/2023", periods=20, freq="D"),
}
```

Then we will create the pipeline file:
```yaml
# news_analysis.pipe
steps:
  - step_name: "classify_news"
    npc: "{{ ref('news_assistant') }}"
    task: |
      Classify the following news articles into one of the categories:
      ["Politics", "Economy", "Technology", "Sports", "Health"].
      {{ source('news_articles') }}

  - step_name: "analyze_news"
    npc: "{{ ref('news_assistant') }}"
    batch_mode: true  # Process articles with knowledge of their tags
    task: |
      Based on the category assigned in {{classify_news}}, provide an in-depth
      analysis and perspectives on the article. Consider these aspects:
      ["Impacts", "Market Reaction", "Cultural Significance", "Predictions"].
      {{ source('news_articles') }}
```

Then we can run the pipeline like so:
```bash
/compile ./npc_team/news_analysis.pipe
```
or in python like:

```bash

from npcsh.npc_compiler import PipelineRunner
import os
runner = PipelineRunner(
    "./news_analysis.pipe",
    db_path=os.path.expanduser("~/npcsh_history.db"),
    npc_root_dir=os.path.abspath("."),
)
results = runner.execute_pipeline()
```

Alternatively, if youd like to use a mixture of agents in your pipeline, set one up like this:
```yaml
steps:
  - step_name: "classify_news"
    npc: "news_assistant"
    mixa: true
    mixa_agents:
      - "{{ ref('news_assistant') }}"
      - "{{ ref('journalist_npc') }}"
      - "{{ ref('data_scientist_npc') }}"
    mixa_voters:
      - "{{ ref('critic_npc') }}"
      - "{{ ref('editor_npc') }}"
      - "{{ ref('researcher_npc') }}"
    mixa_voter_count: 5
    mixa_turns: 3
    mixa_strategy: "vote"
    task: |
      Classify the following news articles...
      {{ source('news_articles') }}
```
You'll have to make npcs for these references to work, here are versions that should work with the above:
```yaml
name: news_assistant
```
Then, we can run the mixture of agents method like:

```bash
/compile ./npc_team/news_analysis_mixa.pipe
```
or in python like:

```bash

from npcsh.npc_compiler import PipelineRunner
import os

runner = PipelineRunner(
    "./news_analysis_mixa.pipe",
    db_path=os.path.expanduser("~/npcsh_history.db"),
    npc_root_dir=os.path.abspath("."),
)
results = runner.execute_pipeline()
```



Note, in the future we will aim to separate compilation and running so that we will have a compilation step that is more like a jinja rendering of the relevant information so that it can be more easily audited.


## npcsql: SQL Integration and pipelines (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)


In addition to NPCs being used in `npcsh` and through the python package, users may wish to take advantage of agentic interactions in SQL-like pipelines.
`npcsh` contains a pseudo-SQL interpreter that processes SQL models which lets users write queries containing LLM-function calls that reference specific NPCs. `npcsh` interprets these queries, renders any jinja template references through its python implementation, and then executes them accordingly.

Here is an example of a SQL-like query that uses NPCs to analyze data:
```sql
SELECT debate(['logician','magician'], 'Analyze the sentiment of the customer feedback.') AS sentiment_analysis
```

### squish
squish is an aggregate NPC LLM function that compresses information contained in whole columns or grouped chunks of data based on the SQL aggregation.

### splat
Splat is a row-wise NPC LLM function that allows for the application of an LLM function on each row of a dataset or a re-sampling
