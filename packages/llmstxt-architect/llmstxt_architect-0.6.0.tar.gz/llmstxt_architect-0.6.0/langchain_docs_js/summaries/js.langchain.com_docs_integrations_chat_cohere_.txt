[](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/cohere/): LLM should read this page when needing to use Cohere's chat models for natural language tasks, when needing to perform web search as part of the model's response generation, or when needing to leverage Cohere's retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. This page covers setting up and using the ChatCohere integration in LangChain.js, including installation, instantiation, invoking the model, chaining with prompts, using RAG, and connecting to web search connectors. It also provides an overview of the model's features and links to the API reference.
