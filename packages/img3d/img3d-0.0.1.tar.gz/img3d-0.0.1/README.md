# Img3D
## Abstract
This repository provides a tool for 3D image transformations, including rotations and translations in spherical coordinates. The transformations operate in three-dimensional space using sequential logic through the main class.

## Description
Image transformation is an integral part of image processing, particularly for data fusion in real-time applications. This class enables users to rotate and translate images in 3D space in any desired configuration.
