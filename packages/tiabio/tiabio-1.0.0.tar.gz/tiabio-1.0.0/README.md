# TIAB IO Python Library

This library helps you interact with the TIAB IO board when writing Python
scripts. Providing easy access to all the commands available on the interactive
console.

See [TIAB IO board examples][io-board-examples] for examples using this library.

This Python library is part of the [Testing In A Box (TIAB) project][tiab-homepage], which aims to provide tools and processes for automating the testing
pipeline of embedded systems.

The TIAB IO board is an open-source project which provides the following
features to the TIAB project:

- USB hub
- USB HID emulation
- USB power delivery
- Programmable DC power output
- LED indication
- Interfaces for UART, JTAG, SWD, SPI, I2C, bit-bang, GPIO
- Optocouplers for interracting with higher voltage circuitry

The TIAB IO board is made up of the following open-source repos:

- [TIAB IO board hardware][io-board-hardware]
- [TIAB IO board firmware][io-board-firmware]
- [TIAB IO board tests][io-board-tests]
- [TIAB IO board case][io-board-case]
- [TIAB IO board Python library][io-board-python]
- [TIAB IO board examples][io-board-examples]
