
class MapsTextSearch:
    """
    Search for an address using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API and handle printing.

    Parameters:
    - user_agent (str): The user agent string to be used by the Nominatim geolocator. Default is "osm_search".

    Methods:
    - search_address(address: str) -> None: Search for the given address and print the details.

    Notes:
    - The class uses the Geopy library to interact with the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
    - Results, including the full address, latitude, and longitude, are printed.
