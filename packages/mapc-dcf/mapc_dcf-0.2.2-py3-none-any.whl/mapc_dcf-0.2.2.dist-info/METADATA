        Statement of Purpose
        
        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
        and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
        authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        
        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
        the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
        scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
        of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
        works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
        and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
        These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
        culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
        works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
        part through the use and efforts of others.
        
        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
        expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
        associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
        is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
        elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
        terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
        Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
        
        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
        limited to, the following:
        
          i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
             communicate, and translate a Work;
         ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
             likeness depicted in a Work;
         iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
             subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
          v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
             in a Work;
         vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
             European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
             protection of databases, and under any national implementation
             thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
             directive); and
        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
             world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
             implementations thereof.
        
        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
        of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
        irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
        Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
        of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
        future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
        worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
        treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
        medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
        including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
        purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
        member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
        successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
        revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
        equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
        as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        
        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
        be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
        Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
        account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
        extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
        person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
        irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
        Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
        time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
        of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
        limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
        "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
        applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
        reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
        partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
        of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
        will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
        Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
        action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
        express Statement of Purpose.
        
        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
        
         a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
            surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
         b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
            statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
            title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
            infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
            the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
            the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
         c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
            that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
            limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
            Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
            consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
            Work.
         d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
            party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
            this CC0 or use of the Work.

# IEEE 802.11 Multi-AP Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) Simulator

`mapc-dcf` is an implementation of the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) with support for Multi-Access Point operation. It is a [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-based Discrete Event Simulator (DES) that models the channel and frame exchange.

## Features and Assumptions

- Supports Multi-AP operation.
- Supports the Spatial Reuse (SR) mechanism introduced in the IEEE 802.11ax standard.
- Supports the AMPDU aggregation mechanism.
- Models collision probability by calculating the interference matrix for each device.
- Monitors and logs the history of frame exchanges.
- Outputs a summary of the simulation.
- Supports scenarios with walls.
- Assumes instantaneous and error-free acknowledgments.
- Assumes an ideal MCS selection mechanism.

## Installation

The package can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install mapc-dcf
```

## Usage

It is best to be used with scenarios defined as in our other [repository](https://github.com/ml4wifi-devs/mapc-optimal-research). In the following example, we show how to use the simulator with a *small_office_scenario* defined in the `mapc_research` package.

```python
from typing import Dict

import simpy
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from mapc_research.envs.scenario_impl import *

from mapc_dcf import AccessPoint, Channel, Logger

# Define the simulation parameters
SIMULATION_LENGTH = 0.1     # seconds
WARMUP_LENGTH = 0.1         # seconds
RESULTS_PATH = "./results"  # Path to save the results (without extension!)
SEED = 42

# Set the random seed
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(SEED)

# Create the SimPy environment
des_env = simpy.Environment()

# Create the logger
logger = Logger(SIMULATION_LENGTH, WARMUP_LENGTH, RESULTS_PATH)

# Define the scenario
scenario = small_office_scenario(d_ap=20, d_sta=2, n_steps=1000)

# Create the channel
key, key_channel = jax.random.split(key)
channel = Channel(
    key=key_channel,
    sr=True,                # Spatial reuse enabled
    pos=scenario.pos,
    walls=scenario.walls    # Scenario with walls
)

# Define the access points
aps: Dict[int, AccessPoint] = {}
for ap_id in scenario.associations:
    key, key_ap = jax.random.split(key)
    clients = jnp.array(scenario.associations[ap_id])
    tx_power = scenario.tx_power[ap_id].item()
    aps[ap_id] = AccessPoint(
        key=key_ap,
        id=ap_id,
        position=scenario.pos,
        tx_power=tx_power,
        mcs=11, # MCS 11, this is legacy, it does not affect
        # the simulation as the MCS is selected ideally inside the DCF
        clients=clients,
        channel=channel,
        des_env=des_env,
        logger=logger
    )

# Start the simulation
for ap_id in aps:
    aps[ap_id].start_operation(run_number=1)   # Run number can be convenient in case of multiple runs
des_env.run(until=WARMUP_LENGTH + SIMULATION_LENGTH)

# Dump the results to the results file
logger.dump_accumulators(run_number=1)
logger.shutdown(config={"scenario": "Optional JSON description of the scenario"})

# Clean up the environment
del des_env
```

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `mapc_dcf/`: The main package of the tool.
  - `channel.py`: Implementation of the `Channel` class with the moset important methods: `is_idle()`, `send_frame()` and `is_tx_successful()`.
  - `constants.py`: Physical and MAC layer constants used in the simulator.
  - `dcf.py`: Logic of the DCF schema which uses the simpy interface to manage time intervals.
  - `logger.py`: Logging module that monitors the frame exchange, dumps results to the output CSV files and summarizes loggs in a compact JSON format.
  - `nodes.py`: Access Point abstraction and traffic generation.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions, including the function for calculation of the path loss from node positions using the TGax channel model.
