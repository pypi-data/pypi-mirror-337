           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

coredumpy saves your crash site for post-mortem debugging.

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/showcase.gif" />
</p>


## Highlights

* Easy to use
* Native support for unittest, pytest and run-time exceptions
* Portable and safe dump
* Support VSCode and pdb interface
* Support multi-threading with VSCode

## Usage

### dump

For `pytest`, you can use `coredumpy` as a plugin

```
# Create a dump in "./dumps" when there's a pytest failure/error
pytest --enable-coredumpy --coredumpy-dir ./dumps
```

For `Exception` and `unittest`, you can use `coredumpy run` command.
A dump will be generated when there's an unhandled exception or a test failure

```
# with no argument coredumpy run will generate the dump in the current dir
coredumpy run my_script.py
coredumpy run my_script.py --directory ./dumps
coredumpy run -m unittest --directory ./dumps
```

Or you can patch explicitly in your code and execute the script/module as usual

```python
import coredumpy
# Create a dump in "./dumps" when there's an unhandled exception
coredumpy.patch_except(directory='./dumps')
# Create a dump in "./dumps" when there's a unittest failure/error
coredumpy.patch_unittest(directory='./dumps')
# Create a dump in "./dumps" when there's a pytest failure/error
coredumpy.patch_pytest(directory='./dumps')
```

<details>

<summary>
Or you can dump the current frame stack manually
</summary>

```python
import coredumpy

# Without frame argument, top frame will be the caller of coredumpy.dump()
coredumpy.dump()
# Specify a specific frame as the top frame to dump
coredumpy.dump(frame)
# Set the search depth to 2 to reduce the dump size
coredumpy.dump(depth=2)
# Specify a filename to save the dump, without it a unique name will be generated
coredumpy.dump(path='coredumpy.dump')
# You can use a function for path
coredumpy.dump(path=lambda: f"coredumpy_{time.time()}.dump")
# Specify a directory to keep the dump
coredumpy.dump(directory='./dumps')
# Specify the description of the dump for peek
coredumpy.dump(description="a random dump")
```

</details>

A [github action](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/upload-coredumpy) is available
to upload your coredumpy dumps and generate a load link to open the dumps in VSCode
directly.

### load

Load your dump with

```
# This will bring up pdb
coredumpy load <your_dump_file>
# This will bring up ipdb, ipython is required
coredumpy load --ipdb <your_dump_file>
```

A debugger will be brought up and of course not everything is supported.

### peek

If you only need some very basic information of the dump (to figure out which dump
you actually need), you can use `peek` command.

```
coredumpy peek <your_dump_directory>
coredumpy peek <your_dump_file1> <your_dump_file2>
```

### VSCode Extension

Download the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gaogaotiantian.coredumpy-vscode)
and right click your dump file - choose `Load with coredumpy`.

### Configuration

All configurations should be done through `coredumpy.config`.
The default value is listed below and you can change them as you need.

```python
from coredumpy import config
# The dump depth if not specified
config.default_recursion_depth: int = 10
# Best effort timeout for dump - not guaranteed. Only checked for each new depth.
config.dump_timeout: int = 60
# Whether dump all threads
config.dump_all_threads: bool = True
# Whether hide strings that match config.secret_patterns
config.hide_secret: bool = True
# The patterns for secrets
config.secret_patterns: list[re.Pattern] = [re.compile(r"[A-Za-z0-9]{32,1024}")]
# Whether hide strings that match os.environ.values()
config.hide_environ: bool = True
# The filter to determine whether an environ should be hidden
config.environ_filter: Callable = lambda env: len(env) > 8
```

## Type support

`coredumpy` supports the common built-in types like `float`, `int`, `str`, `list`,
`dict` etc. For all the other types that it can't recognize, it will treat them as
a Python object, which means `coredumpy` will iterate and store all the attributes
of the object.

You can add support for any arbitrary types by creating a class that inherits
`coredumpy.TypeSupportBase`. You need to finish the following class methods in
order to make it work:

```python
@classmethod
def get_type(cls) -> tuple[Union[type, Callable], str]:
    # returns a tuple with two elements:
    # 0. type (or a callable for lazy load) for dump
    #    coredumpy will dispatch the objects with this type to the dump method
    # 1. a type string for load
    #    coredumpy will dispatch the data with this type to the load method

@classmethod
def dump(cls, obj) -> tuple[dict, Optional[list]]:
    # takes the object to be dumped
    # returns a tuple with two elements:
    # 0. a json-serializable dict, which will be stored in the dump file
    # 1. a list that contains the objects needed to be dumped for this object
    #    if none needed (the object is not a container), use None

@classmethod
def load(cls, data: dict, objects: dict) -> tuple[object, Optional[list[str]]]:
    # takes the dict data from `dump` method and a dict of all objects with the ids
    # as keys
    # returns a tuple with two elements:
    # 0. the restored object. If not ready, return coredumpy.NotReady
    # 1. a list of the ids of dependent objects, if not applicable, use None
```

If the type is a container, inherit `coredumpy.TypeSupportContainerBase` and
implement an extra method:

```python
@classmethod
def reload(cls, container, data, objects: dict) -> tuple[object, Optional[list[str]]]:
    # takes the already built container, the other arguments are the same as `load`
    # returns the same as `load`
    # This is helpful to create a placeholder first with `load` so the other objects
    # can reference to it, and build the placeholder later
```

You only need to create the class, it will be automatically registered.

## Startup script

In order to import the type supports and do some customization, `coredumpy` provides
a way to run an arbitrary script after importing `coredumpy`. You can put a
`conf_coredumpy.py` file in your current working directory. If `coredumpy` discovers
it, the script will be executed. You can put anything you need in the script.

Or if you prefer to do it explicitly, you can pass `--conf your_conf_file.py` to
`coredumpy run` or `coredumpy load` command to run that specified file.

## About the data

Besides a couple of builtin types, coredumpy treats almost every object as an
Python object with attributes, and that's what it records in the dump.

That being said, most of the objects will not be "restored" as they were when
being dumped. You are in an observer mode where you can inspect attributes of
all objects. None of the methods of the objects would work, nor would any
dymanic features.

### Why not `pickle`?

* Most importantly, `pickle` does not always work. You can't partially pickle
  something, which means if you have an unpickleable object, you are doomed.
* `pickle` requires the same environment to deserialize the objects, which
  defeats the original purpose of loading the dump anywhere.
* `pickle` is unsafe by design and we don't want unnecessary hesitation when
  users try to load a dump from an untrusted source.

### Security concerns

Because coredumpy dumps the whole frame stack, you should take care of your
sensitive information.

#### API Keys

coredumpy has a default-on filter for strings that looks like API keys
(`"[A-Za-z0-9]{32,1024}"`), but if you know what your key looks like,
you should add the pattern to protect your keys.

```python
from coredumpy import config
config.secret_patterns.append(re.compile("<your API key pattern>"))
```

You can edit `config.secret_patterns` as you wish, it's a list of
`re.Pattern`s that coredumpy will use to match against all strings.

If you need to turn off this feature:

```python
from coredumpy import config
config.hide_secret = False
```

#### Environs

It's common to store sensitive data in your environment variables, so coredumpy
also has a default-on filter for environs. It will redact all strings if they
are in `os.environ` and their length > 8. You can change the filter by

```python
from coredumpy import config
# Only redact if the length > 16
config.environ_filter = lambda env: len(env) > 16
```

Turn this filter off with
```python
from coredumpy import config
config.hide_environ = False
```
