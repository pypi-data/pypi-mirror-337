# Pycord Reactive Views

Pycord Reactive Views is a powerful library that extends [Pycord](https://pycord.dev),
bringing reactive programming to Discord bot development. It enables developers to
create dynamic, responsive user interfaces for their bots with ease.

## What is Reactivity?

Reactivity is a programming paradigm commonly used in front-end development. It allows
for the creation of dynamic user interfaces that update in real-time based on changes in
the underlying data. Pycord Reactive Views brings this powerful concept to Discord bot
development.

In Pycord, reactivity is implemented through `View` classes. These classes are
responsible for:

- Rendering the user interface
- Updating the UI in response to data changes
- Handling user interactions

## Features

- **Reactive Components**: Create buttons, select menus, and other Discord components
  that automatically update based on your bot's state.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Define your UI logic in a clear, declarative manner.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Pycord projects.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficiently updates only the components that have changed.

## Installation

To install Pycord Reactive Views, use pip:

```bash
pip install pycord-reactive-views
```

Ensure you have Pycord installed as well:

```bash
pip install py-cord
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of a reactive counter view:

```python
from pycord_reactive_views import ReactiveView, ReactiveButton, ReactiveValue

class Counter(ReactiveView):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.counter = 0
        self.counter_button = ReactiveButton(
            label=ReactiveValue(lambda: f"Count: {self.counter}", "Count: 0"),
            style=ReactiveValue(
                lambda: discord.ButtonStyle.primary if self.counter % 2 == 0 else discord.ButtonStyle.secondary,
                discord.ButtonStyle.primary,
            ),
        )
        self.reset_button = ReactiveButton(
            label="Reset",
            style=discord.ButtonStyle.danger,
            disabled=ReactiveValue(lambda: self.counter == 0, True),
        )
        self.counter_button.callback = self._increment
        self.reset_button.callback = self._reset
        self.add_item(self.counter_button)
        self.add_item(self.reset_button)

    async def _increment(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> None:
        await interaction.response.defer()
        self.counter += 1
        await self.update()

    async def _reset(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> None:
        await interaction.response.defer()
        self.counter = 0
        await self.update()

# Usage in your bot
@bot.command()
async def counter(ctx):
    view = Counter()
    await Counter().send(ctx)
```

![Counter Example](./assets/counter.gif)

This example demonstrates how to bind a button's label, style, and disabled state to
functions that determine their values based on the current state of the counter.
