class RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter:
    """
    A class for splitting text into chunks recursively based on specified separators.

    This class implements a recursive algorithm to split text into chunks of a specified size,
    with an optional overlap between chunks. It uses a list of separators to determine where
    to split the text, starting with the first separator in the list and moving to the next
    if the current separator is not found in the text.

    Attributes:
        chunk_size (int): The maximum size of each chunk.
        chunk_overlap (int): The number of characters to overlap between chunks.
        separators (List[str]): A list of separators to use for splitting the text.
