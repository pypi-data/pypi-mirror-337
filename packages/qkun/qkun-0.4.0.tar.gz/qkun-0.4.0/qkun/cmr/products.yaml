        The primary sensor aboard the PACE spacecraft is the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI).
        It is a highly advanced optical spectrometer that will be used to measure properties of light over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
        It will enable continuous measurement of light at finer wavelength resolution than previous NASA satellite sensors, 
        extending key system ocean color data records for climate studies.

        This is the wide-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track.
        The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. 
        I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is about 200 km cross-track. 
        Thus, MAC02QS1 cross-track width is 804 pixels for radiances. 
        Geolocations, however, are 1-km at best, and thus the cross-track width for geolocations is 201 pixels.
        Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.

        In the standard product, the 250 meter MODIS Level 1B data set contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 2 discrete bands 
        located in the 0.62 to 0.88 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
        These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr).
        In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for these solar reflective bands through 
        knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry).
        Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.

      description: |
        The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) 
        polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder 
        for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors.
        The AIRS Visible/Near Infrared (VIS/NIR) Level 1B QA Subset contains Quality Assurance (QA) parameters that a may use of 
        filter AIRS VIS/NIR Level 1B radiance data to create a subset of analysis. It includes "state" that user should check before 
        using any VIS/NIR Level 1B data radiance and "glintlat", "glintlon", and "sun_glint_distant" that users can use to check for 
        possibility of solar glint contamination. AIRS VIS/NIR Level 1B radiance data can be found in AIRVBRAD.

        Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.
        The 1BGMI algorithm uses a non-linear three-point in-flight calibration to derive antenna temperature (Ta) and convert Ta to Tb
        using GMI antenna pattern corrections. The four-point calibration, which utilizes noise diode measurements, is used to monitor
        the sensor non-linearty. The noise diode measurements also provide a hot load back-up calibration in case hot load measurements are lost.
        Details are in the GMI ATBD. The 1BGMI algorithm and software transform Level 0 counts into geolocated and calibrated
        brightness temperatures (Tb) for 13 GMI channels.
