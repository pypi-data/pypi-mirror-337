[bind_tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/#tool-binding): LLM should read this page when building applications that require an LLM to directly interact with external systems or APIs, when integrating tools or functions into an LLM workflow, or when fine-tuning an LLM to better handle tool calling. This page provides an overview of tool calling, which allows LLMs to invoke external tools or APIs with specific input schemas. It covers key concepts like tool creation, binding tools to LLMs, initiating tool calls from LLMs, and executing the called tools. It also offers guidance on recommended usage and best practices.
