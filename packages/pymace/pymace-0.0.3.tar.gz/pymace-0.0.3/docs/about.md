## History
This project was initially developed after the [Air Cargo Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Cargo_Challenge) 2022 in [Munich](https://akamodell-muenchen.de/en/air-cargo-challenge-2022/). Build initially in two bachelor thesis by Gregor Zwickl and Tjalf Stadel, it was further developed by Jannik Frank for the [ACC2024 in Aachen](). At this competition our plane not only performed exactly as designed but stomped the competition. In an effort to clean up the source code, the Akamodell Stuttgart decided to puplish the project and create this package.
