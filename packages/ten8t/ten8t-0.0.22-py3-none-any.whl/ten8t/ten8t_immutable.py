"""
Helper classes to support making environment variables with mutable values be less prone
to being changed by mistake.  We are under no presumption that we can stop people from
using a dynamic language.  These classes make the best effort to  prevent the user from
making edits to environment data that should be constant for the life of a rule
checking run.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL WORK IN ALL CASES. DON'T WRITE TO THE ENV VARIABLES!

    Class representing a mutation-inhibited list. Mutational operations raise

    to prevent accidental changes by raising exceptions for mutating methods.

    Ideally, a copy is best to avoid mutation. But for large data sets, it's
    resource-demanding. ImmutableList protects large sets from unintended changes.
