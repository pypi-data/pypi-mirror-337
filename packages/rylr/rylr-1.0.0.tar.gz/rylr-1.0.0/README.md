RYLR is a Python library for RYLR LoRa transceivers to simplifies communication with RYLR modules using Python. It provides an interface to send and receive LoRa messages, configure module parameters (e.g., frequency, spreading factor, and power settings), and manage network communication. The library abstracts the AT command interactions, making it easier to integrate LoRa connectivity into Python projects without dealing with low-level serial communication details.

Support for RYLR896 and RYLR406.
