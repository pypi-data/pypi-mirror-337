# LLM Commit Generator

This blueprint guides you to easily generate AI-powered git commit messages based on your code changes. It uses local LLMs via Jan AI or Ollama to analyze git diffs and suggest concise, relevant commit messages.

ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ“– For more detailed guidance on using this project, please visit our [**Docs here**](https://tooluse.github.io/llmcommit/)

### Built with

- Python 3.10+
- [Jan AI](https://jan.ai) for a user-friendly local AI experience
- Open-source LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) as an alternative
- fzf for terminal UI

## Quick-start

1. Make sure you have Git, Python 3.10+, and pip installed
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install llm-commit-generator
   ```
3. Choose one of the following local inference options:

   **Option 1: Jan AI (Default)**

   - Install [Jan AI](https://jan.ai) and download a model (like Llama 3.1) through its interface
   - Start the Jan AI application and ensure it's running

   **Option 2: Ollama**

   - Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and pull a model:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```

4. After adding your changes to your git repo, run:

   ```bash
   lcm
   ```

   For Ollama, use:

   ```bash
   lcm --ollama
   ```

## How it Works

1. The tool extracts your git diff (staged changes, or unstaged if no staged changes)
2. Sends the diff to an AI model with a prompt to generate concise commit messages
3. Presents you with message suggestions in a terminal UI using fzf
4. After selecting a message, commits your changes with the selected message

## Pre-requisites

- **System requirements**:

  - OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux
  - Python 3.10 or higher
  - Git
  - fzf (for terminal UI)
  - Jan AI or Ollama for local inference

- **Dependencies**:
  - Dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`

## Troubleshooting

- If you get `fzf: command not found`, install fzf: [fzf installation guide](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation)
- For Jan AI issues, ensure the Jan AI application is running
- For Ollama issues, ensure the Ollama service is running and your model is pulled
