    Support for Qiskit Nature 0.5.
upgrade:
  - |
    Support for Qiskit Nature < 0.5 has been removed upon this release.

    Users are now be required to use the ``qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem``,
    as input to the ``EntanglementForgingGroundStateSolver``, rather than the deprecated ``qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem``.

    For more information on migrating to Qiskit Nature 0.5, check out the
    `Qiskit Nature migration guide <https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-nature/migration/0.5_a_intro.html>`_.

    For more information on adapting your entanglement forging workflows, check
    out the ``tutorials <Forging tutorials>`` and ``how-to guides <Forging how-tos>``.

    The ``~circuit_knitting_toolbox.utils.IntegralDriver`` class has been removed. The new Qiskit Nature
    API allows for a more flexible build-up of the ``qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem``,
    and this driver is no longer needed.
