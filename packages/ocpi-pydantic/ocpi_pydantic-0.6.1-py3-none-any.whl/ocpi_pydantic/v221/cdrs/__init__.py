    - `uid`:  
        Unique ID by which this Token can be identified.
        This is the field used by the CPO’s system (RFID reader on the Charge Point) to
        identify this token.
        Currently, in most cases: type=RFID, this is the RFID hidden ID as read by the
        RFID reader, but that is not a requirement.
        If this is a type=APP_USER Token, it will be a unique, by the eMSP, generated
        ID.
    - `contract_id`:
        Uniquely identifies the EV driver contract token within the eMSP’s platform (and
        suboperator platforms). Recommended to follow the specification for eMA ID
        from "eMI3 standard version V1.0" (http://emi3group.com/documents-links/)

    A Charging Period consists of a start timestamp and a list of possible values that influence this period, for example: amount of energy charged this period, maximum current during this period etc.
