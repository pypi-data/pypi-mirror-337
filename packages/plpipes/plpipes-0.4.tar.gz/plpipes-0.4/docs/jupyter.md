
# Jupyter integration

PLPipes includes an IPython extension which exposes the framework
functionality in Jupyter notebooks.

## Initialization

The extension is loaded adding the following lines at the beginning of
your notebook:

```python
%load_ext plpipes.jupyter
%plpipes {stem}
```

Where `{stem}` is the name used as the main key when looking for
configuration files (defaults to `jupyter`).

In order to find the project configuration, the extension looks into
the environment variable `PLPIPES_ROOT_DIR`. If that variable is not
defined then it looks for a `config` directory in the current working
directory of the IPython kernel (usually the directory from where
`jupyter-lab` was launched) and walks up the file system until such
directory is found.

Once the extension is loaded and initialized, the features described
in the following sections can be used.

## Variable, packages and method shortcuts

The following variables and methods are made available in the session:

* `cfg`: The configuration object

* `input_dir`, `work_dir` and `output_dir`: `libpath` objects pointing
    to the input, work and output directories.

    For instance:
    ```python
    df = pandas.read_csv(input_dir / "data001.csv")
    ```

* `db`: a shortcut for `plpipes.database`

* `create_table` and `query`: shortcuts for the functions of the same
    name in `plpipes.database`.


## SQL integration

*Note: due to some incompatibility with recent versions of `ipython-sql` the
SQL integration is currently disabled.*


The IPython SQL extension (see https://pypi.org/project/ipython-sql/)
is automatically loaded and the configured PLPipes `work` database set
as the default one.

Other databases configured in PLPipes can be selected using a double
at sign (`@@`) followed by the database name.  For instance:

```sql
%%sql @@input
select * from customers
limit 100
```
