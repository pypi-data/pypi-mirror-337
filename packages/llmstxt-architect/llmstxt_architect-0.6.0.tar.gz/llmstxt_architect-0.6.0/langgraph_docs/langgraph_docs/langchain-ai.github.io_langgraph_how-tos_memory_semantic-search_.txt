[How to add semantic search to your agent's memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/memory/semantic-search/): LLM should read this page when implementing semantic search in agent memory, enabling memory-aware AI assistants, or configuring advanced memory retrieval systems. This page demonstrates how to add semantic search to LangGraph agent memory stores, covering basic setup with embeddings, storing memories, searching by semantic similarity, integrating memory in agents and ReAct agents, and advanced usage like multi-vector indexing and selective memory indexing.
