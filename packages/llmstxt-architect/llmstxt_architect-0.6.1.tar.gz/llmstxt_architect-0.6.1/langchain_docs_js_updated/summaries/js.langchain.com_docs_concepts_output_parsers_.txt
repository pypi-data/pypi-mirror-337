[Output Parsers](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/output_parsers/): LLM should read this page when needing to parse structured outputs from language models, when handling JSON/XML responses from LLMs, or when selecting appropriate output parsers for specific data formats. (This page describes various output parsers in LangChain that transform LLM outputs into structured formats. It covers JSON, XML, CSV, OutputFixing, Datetime, and Structured parsers, with details about their streaming support, format instructions, and use cases. The page notes that function/tool calling is recommended over output parsing when possible.)
