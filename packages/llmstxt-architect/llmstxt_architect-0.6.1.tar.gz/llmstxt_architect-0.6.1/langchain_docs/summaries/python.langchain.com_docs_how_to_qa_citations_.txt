[How to: return citations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/qa_citations/): LLM should read this page when seeking to add citations to results from a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application, when wanting to justify an answer using source material, and when needing to provide evidence for generated outputs. The page covers various methods for getting a RAG application to cite sources used in generating answers, including tool-calling to return source IDs or text snippets, direct prompting to generate structured outputs with citations, retrieving and compressing context to minimize need for citations, and post-processing generated answers to annotate with citations.
