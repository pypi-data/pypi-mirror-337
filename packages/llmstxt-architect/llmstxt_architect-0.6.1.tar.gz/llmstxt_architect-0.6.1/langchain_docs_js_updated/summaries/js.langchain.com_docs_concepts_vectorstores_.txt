[Vector stores](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/vectorstores/): LLM should read this page when (needing to understand vector stores for RAG applications, implementing semantic search capabilities, or working with document embeddings) (Vector stores are specialized data stores for indexing and retrieving information using vector representations called embeddings. The page covers the standard interface for working with vector stores including initialization, adding documents, deleting documents, and conducting similarity searches. It explains similarity metrics, search algorithms, metadata filtering, and advanced techniques like Maximal Marginal Relevance to improve search quality and diversity.)
