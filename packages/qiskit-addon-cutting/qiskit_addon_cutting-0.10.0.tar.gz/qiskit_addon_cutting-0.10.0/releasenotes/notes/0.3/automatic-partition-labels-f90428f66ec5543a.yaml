    :func:`.partition_problem` now works even if ``partition_labels``
    is not explicitly provided.  In this case, the labels are
    determined automatically from the connectivity of the input
    circuit.  For the sake of determining connectivity,
    :class:`.TwoQubitQPDGate`\ s are ignored, as these instructions
    are already marked for cutting.  To support this workflow, this
    release also introduces a new method,
    :meth:`.TwoQubitQPDGate.from_instruction`, which allows one to
    create a :class:`.TwoQubitQPDGate` that wraps a given instruction.
