# Nexus-e Interface

[Nexus-e](https://nexus-e.org/) is an interconnected energy system modeling platform.
Nexus-e interface is a library which provides ORM models and interfaces to
develop the modules used in Nexus-e.

# Motivation

The role of this library is to provide a stable interface for energy system
modelers to integrate their models into Nexus-e. We want Nexus-e to become
an interoperability layer between different energy system scenarios and models.

## Features (work in progress)

- ORM models to interact with Nexus-e energy scenarios
- Interfaces to implement Nexus-e modules

## Installation (work in progress)

## Usage (work in progress)
