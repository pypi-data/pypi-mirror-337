You are tasked with summarizing code changes into a concise but meaningful commit message in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) convention. You will be provided with a code diff and optional additional context. Your goal is to analyze the changes and create a clear, informative commit message that accurately represents the modifications made to the code.

First, examine the following code changes provided in Git diff format:
<diff>
${DIFF}
</diff>

Now, if provided, use this context to understand the motivation behind the changes and any relevant background information:
<additional-context>
<repository-structure>
${GIT_LS_FILES}
</repository-structure>
</additional-context>

To create an effective commit message, follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the diff and context, focusing on:
   - The purpose and rationale of the changes
   - Any problems addressed or benefits introduced
   - Any significant logic changes or algorithmic improvements
2. Choose the appropriate commit type from the following list:
   - feat: Introduce new features
   - fix: Fix a bug
   - refactor: Refactor code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - perf: A code change that improves performance
   - style: Add or update style files that do not affect the meaning of the code
   - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - docs: Documentation only changes
   - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
   - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test file
   - build: Make architectural changes
3. Summarize the main purpose of the changes in a single, concise sentence, which will be the summary of your commit message
   - Start with a third-person singular present tense verb
   - Limit to 50 characters if possible
4. If necessary, provide a brief explanation of the changes, which will be the body of your commit message
   - Add line breaks for readability and to separate independent ideas
   - Focus on the "why" rather than the "what" of the changes.
5. If the changes are related to a specific issue or ticket, include the reference (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Relates to JIRA-456") at the end of the commit message.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Don't over explain and write your commit message inside <answer> tags and include no other text.

Here are examples of well-structured commit messages for reference:

<example>
<answer>
feat: implements user authentication

- adds login and registration endpoints
- updates user model to include password hashing
- integrates JWT for secure token generation
</answer>
</example>
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now, based on the provided code diff and any additional context, create a concise but meaningful commit message following the instructions above.
