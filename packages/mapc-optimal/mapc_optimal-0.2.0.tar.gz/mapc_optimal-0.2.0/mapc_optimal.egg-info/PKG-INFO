        Statement of Purpose
        
        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
        and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
        authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        
        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
        the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
        scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
        of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
        works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
        and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
        These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
        culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
        works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
        part through the use and efforts of others.
        
        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
        expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
        associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
        is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
        elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
        terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
        Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
        
        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
        limited to, the following:
        
          i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
             communicate, and translate a Work;
         ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
             likeness depicted in a Work;
         iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
             subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
          v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
             in a Work;
         vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
             European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
             protection of databases, and under any national implementation
             thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
             directive); and
        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
             world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
             implementations thereof.
        
        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
        of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
        irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
        Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
        of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
        future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
        worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
        treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
        medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
        including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
        purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
        member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
        successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
        revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
        equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
        as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        
        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
        be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
        Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
        account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
        extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
        person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
        irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
        Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
        time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
        of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
        limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
        "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
        applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
        reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
        partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
        of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
        will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
        Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
        action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
        express Statement of Purpose.
        
        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
        
         a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
            surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
         b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
            statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
            title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
            infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
            the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
            the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
         c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
            that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
            limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
            Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
            consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
            Work.

# Optimal solution for IEEE 802.11 MAPC Coordinated Spatial Reuse (C-SR) problem

`mapc-optimal` is a tool for finding the optimal solution of the Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC) scheduling 
problem with coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR) for IEEE 802.11 networks. It provides a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) solution to find the upper bound on network performance. A detailed description can be found in:

- Maksymilian Wojnar, Wojciech Ciężobka, Artur Tomaszewski, Piotr Chołda, Krzysztof Rusek, Katarzyna Kosek-Szott, Jetmir Haxhibeqiri, Jeroen Hoebeke, Boris Bellalta, Anatolij Zubow, Falko Dressler, and Szymon Szott. "Coordinated Spatial Reuse Scheduling With Machine Learning in IEEE 802.11 MAPC Networks", 2025.

## Features

- **Calculation of optimal scheduling**: Calculate the best transmission configurations and the corresponding time 
  division that enhance the network performance.
- **Two optimization criteria**: Find the optimal solution for two optimization criteria: maximizing the sum of the 
  throughput of all nodes in the network and maximizing the minimum throughput of all nodes in the network.
- **Modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection**: Select the optimal MCS for each transmission.
- **Transmission power selection**: Set the appropriate transmission power to maximize network performance.
- **Versatile network configuration**: Define network settings by specifying network nodes, available MCSs, 
  and transmission power levels.

## Installation

The package can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install mapc-optimal
```

## Usage

The main functionality is provided by the `Solver` class in `mapc_optimal/solver.py`. This class manages the process of 
finding the optimal solution. Example usage:

```python
from mapc_optimal import Solver

# Define your network
# ...

solver = Solver(stations, access_points)
configurations, rate = solver(path_loss)
```

where `stations` and `access_points` are lists of numbers representing the stations and access points (APs) in the 
network, respectively. The `path_loss` is an $n \times n$ matrix representing the path loss between each pair of nodes 
in the network. The solver returns calculated configurations and the total throughput of the network. The `Solver` 
class can be further configured by passing additional arguments to the constructor. The full list of arguments can 
be found in the [documentation](...). 

By default, the solver associates APs with the stations that have the highest signal strength. However, the solver can
be configured to use a different association policy. To do so, set the `associations` argument when calling the solver. 
Additionally, the solver can return a list of the pricing objective values for each iteration. It can be useful to 
check if the solver has converged. To do so, set the `return_objective` argument to `True` when calling the solver:

```python
configurations, rate, objectives = solver(path_loss, associations, return_objective=True)
```

For a more detailed example, refer to the test case in `test/test_solver.py`.

**Note:** The underlying MILP solver can significantly affect the performance of the tool. By default, the solver 
uses the `CBC` solver from the `PuLP` package. However, we recommend using a better solver, such as `CPLEX`.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `mapc_optimal/`: The main package of the tool.
  - `constants.py`: Default values of the parameters used in the solver.
  - `main.py`: The formulation of the main problem solving the selection and division of configurations.
  - `pricing.py`: The pricing algorithm used to propose new configurations for the main problem.
  - `solver.py`: The solver class coordinating the overall process of finding the optimal solution. It initializes the 
     solver, sets up the network configuration, and manages the iterations.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions, including the function for calculation of the path loss from node positions using 
    the TGax channel model.
- `test/`: Unit tests with example usage of the tool.
