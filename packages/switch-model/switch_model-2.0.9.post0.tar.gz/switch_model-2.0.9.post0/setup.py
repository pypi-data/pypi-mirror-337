"""Setup script for Switch.

Use "pip install --upgrade ." to install a copy in the site packages directory.

Use "pip install --upgrade --editable ." to install Switch to be run from its
current location.

Optional dependencies can be added during the initial install or later by
running a command like this:
pip install --upgrade --editable .[advanced,database_access]

Use "pip uninstall switch" to uninstall switch from your system.
