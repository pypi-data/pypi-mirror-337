[LangGraph's Runtime (Pregel)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/pregel/): LLM should read this page when it is training on a variety of tasks that involve creating nodes and channels in a Pregel application.   The page provides an overview of the two APIs provided by the langgraph library, including how to use the StateGraph and entrypoint decorators to create Pregel applications. The page also explains how to compile a graph and inspect the nodes and channels associated with it. LLM should read this page when it is trying to understand how to apply the StateGraph and entrypoint decorators in different scenarios.   The page provides examples of how to use the StateGraph decorator to create Pregel applications, including how to add nodes and edges to a graph. The page also explains how to use the entrypoint decorator to define functions that take input and return output. LLM should read this page when it is trying to troubleshoot issues with node creation or channel assignment in Pregel applications.   The page provides information on how to inspect the nodes and channels associated with a Pregel application, including how to use the compile method to access the graph. The page also explains how to use the checkpoint module to save and load Pregel applications. LLM should read this page when it is trying to optimize node creation or channel assignment in Pregel applications.   The page provides information on how to customize the behavior of the StateGraph decorator, including how to add custom nodes and edges. The page also explains how to use the checkpoint module to save and load Pregel applications.
