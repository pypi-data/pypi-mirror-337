This module restricts the addresses to be used in the sales order form to only
addresses of the selected customer.

When managing dropship delivery addresses, a delivery address needs to be created
for the buyer main contact. You can then mark the checkbox 'Dropship Address' on
the delivery address to prevent the buyer main contact name to be displayed as
part of the delivery address name.
