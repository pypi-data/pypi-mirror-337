# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently focusing on **enhanced flexibility and usability** while maintaining strict MCP compliance. We're implementing practical features that make the service more useful in real-world scenarios.

## Recent Changes

1. **Enhanced Image Input Support**:

   - Added support for image URLs
   - Added support for local file paths
   - Implemented automatic detection and conversion
   - Created robust error handling for various input types

2. **Improved Testing**:

   - Added comprehensive tests for all input formats
   - Implemented test fixtures for consistent testing
   - Added mocked API responses
   - Ensured all code is formatted with black

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Enhanced README with more detailed examples
   - Added examples for different image input methods
   - Updated memory bank documentation

## Current Implementation Status

- ✅ Core MCP server implemented with FastMCP
- ✅ `image_analysis` tool with flexible input handling
- ✅ Robust error handling and input validation
- ✅ Comprehensive tests for functionality
- ✅ Configuration via environment variables

## Active Decisions

1. **Input Flexibility**: Added support for multiple image input formats to make the service more practical and user-friendly

2. **Configuration**: Using primarily environment variables for simple configuration

3. **Error Handling**: Implemented a comprehensive exception hierarchy for different error cases

4. **Testing**: Focused on thorough testing with mocks to ensure reliability without requiring actual API calls

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Consider optimizing handling of large images
2. **Documentation Expansion**: Add more examples covering different use cases and models
3. **Specialized Tools**: Consider adding more specialized vision analysis tools
4. **Deployment Guidance**: Enhance deployment documentation for production use

## Implementation Principles

1. **Practical Usability**: Implement features that make the service more useful in real-world scenarios
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and graceful failure
3. **MCP Compatibility**: Ensure all tools work correctly with standard MCP clients
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain high test coverage to ensure reliability
