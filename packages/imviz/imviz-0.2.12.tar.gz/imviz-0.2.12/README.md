# imviz

Pythonic bindings for the great [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and
[implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) libraries.

## What?

The goal of this project is to create bindings, which map the immediate mode
gui paradigm in a pythonic way, so that writing GUIs in python (especially
visualization heavy ones, meaning plots and stuff) becomes easy.

## Why?

While writing visualization tools for research, I (personally) found the
different python bindings of imgui/implot somewhat unsatisfactory, because:

* [pyimgui](https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui) maps the api but does not
  include implot
* [imgui\_datascience](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_datascience) seems
  abandoned and does not include implot
* [dearpygui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) includes implot, but
  does not replicate the immediate mode paradigm in python

## Who?

This is for the people who are too impatient to wait for matplotlib to render
10e5 data points. And for the people who are just completely unwilling (me) or
utterly incapable (also me) to deal with application state management in PyQt
(otherwise [pyqtgraph](http://pyqtgraph.org/) would be fine). 

## How?

[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## Installation

OpenGL libraries, GLFW, and GLEW are mandatory dependencies and are expected
to be installed on the system.

On Ubuntu 22.04 OpenGL libraries are already installed and GLFW, GLEW can be
installed with:

```
sudo apt-get install -y libglfw3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libglew-dev
```

### Via PyPI

For convenience a source distribution is available on PyPI. Install
via pip:

```
python3 -m pip install imviz
```

### From Source

The ```setup.py``` script configures and builds the project via cmake, which in
turn downloads further required dependencies. An internet connection is
therefore necessary at build time.

The project can then be installed by executing the following command in the
project root directory:

```
python3 -m pip install .
```
