    "The molecular representation that is most relevant to this algorithm is the `.mol` file. GDB13 and GDB17 databases contain molecules in `.smi` format, which is for the SMILES molecular representation. Additionally, the COCONUT database contains molecules in `.sdf` format, which is closely related to the `.mol` format. The following functions utilize RDKit and allow for simple conversion and handling of the file types, ultimately to the `.mol` format. \n",

Here, \"even sampling\" means taking a random sample of all molecules in the file, rather than only the least complex molecules from the beginning. Even sampling doesn't pertain to `4.smi` and `5.smi` because all molecules are taken from those files. Random sampling is accomplished throughout this code using `numpy.random.choice`. \n",

These seven files are combined into a single `.sdf` file in the command line using the `cat` function. Finally, the single `.sdf` file is split into 1,201 individual `.mol` files. "
