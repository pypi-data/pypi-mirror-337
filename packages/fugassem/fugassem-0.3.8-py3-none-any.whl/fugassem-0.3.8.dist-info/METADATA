FUGAsseM is a computational tool based on a “guild by association” approach to predict functions of novel gene products in the context of microbial communities. It uses machine learning methods to predict functions of microbial proteins by integrating multiple types of community-based data, including co-expression patterns from metatranscriptomics, co-localization patterns from metagenomic assemblies, homologous-based annotation, domain-based annotations, etc.
