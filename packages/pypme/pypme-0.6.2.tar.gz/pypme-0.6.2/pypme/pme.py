"""Calculate PME (Public Market Equivalent) for both evenly and unevenly spaced
cashflows. 

Calculation according to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Market_Equivalent#Modified_PME

Args:
- `dates`: The points in time. (Only for `xpme` variants.)
- `cashflows`: The cashflows from a transaction account perspective.
- `prices`: Asset's prices at each interval / point in time.
- `pme_prices`: PME's prices at each interval / point in time.

Note:
- Both `prices` and `pme_prices` need an additional item at the end for the last
  interval / point in time, for which the PME is calculated.
- `cashflows` has one fewer entry than the other lists because the last cashflow is
  implicitly assumed to be the current NAV at that time.

Verbose versions return a tuple with:
- PME IRR
- Asset IRR
- Dataframe containing all the cashflows, prices, and values used to derive the PME
