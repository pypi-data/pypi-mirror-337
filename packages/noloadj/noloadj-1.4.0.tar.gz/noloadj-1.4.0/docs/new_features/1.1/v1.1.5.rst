Whatâ€™s new in version 1.1.5
===========================
Version available since September 15th 2022


New Features
------------
- a new method of result class, plotPareto, to display Pareto Front easier.
- a new method of result class, addParetoList, to display several Pareto Front in one graph.
- constraints are displayed on the Pareto Front.
- method plotXY of iteration class displays one output per graph, and is able to display vectorial outputs.
- a new function, optim2d_weighting, to solve bi-objective optimisation problems with ponderation method
(a parameter 'method2d' is added on the optim.run function to switch between methods).
- handle exceptions when specifications variable does not belong to the model outputs.
- a new package, ODE, with functions to solve ODE systems for dynamic optimization.
