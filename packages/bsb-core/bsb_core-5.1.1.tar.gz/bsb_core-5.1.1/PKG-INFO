# BSB: A component framework for neural modelling

Developed by the Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Pavia,
the BSB is a component framework for neural modelling, which focuses on component
declarations to piece together a model. The component declarations can be made in any
supported configuration language, or using the library functions in Python. It offers
parallel reconstruction and simulation of any network topology, placement and/or
connectivity strategy.


## Installation

The BSB requires Python 3.9+.

### pip

Any package in the BSB ecosystem can be installed from PyPI through `pip`. Most users
will want to install the main [bsb](https://pypi.org/project/bsb/) framework:

```
pip install "bsb"
```

Advanced users looking to control install an unconventional combination of plugins might
be better off installing just this package, and the desired plugins:

```
pip install "bsb-core"
```

Note that installing `bsb-core` does not come with any plugins installed and the usually
available storage engines, or configuration parsers will be missing.

### Developers

Developers best use pip's *editable* install. This creates a live link between the
installed package and the local git repository:

```
 git clone git@github.com:dbbs-lab/bsb-core
 cd bsb
 pip install -e .[dev]
 pre-commit install
```

## Usage

The scaffold framework is best used in a project context. Create a working directory for
each of your modelling projects and use the command line to configure, reconstruct or
simulate your models.

### Creating a project

You can create a quickstart project using:

```
bsb new my_model --quickstart
cd my_model
```

This will create a `my_model` folder for you with some starter files. It should contain:

- `network_configuration.yaml`: A configuration file in which your network will be described.
- A `pyproject.toml` file: This file uses the TOML syntax to set configuration values for the BSB.
- A `placement.py` and `connectome.py` files if you want to make your own components.

### Reconstructing a network

Within your project folder, you can create reconstructions of your model, generating cell positions
and connections:

```
bsb compile
```

The `compile` command should produce a network file located in your project
folder based on your configuration file.

### Simulating a network

The starter project contains no simulation configuration but the documentation provides tutorials
for the neural simulators supported by the BSB.
