# Python Package
The `maverick-coref-de` Python package provides an easy API to use German Maverick models, enabling efficient and accurate coreference resolution with few lines of code.

Install the library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/maverick-coref-de/)

```bash
pip install maverick-coref-de
```
or from source 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fynnos/maverick-coref.git
cd maverick-coref
pip install -e .
```

## Loading a Pretrained Model
Maverick models can be loaded using huggingface_id or local path:
```bash
from maverick_de import Maverick
model = Maverick(
  hf_name_or_path = "maverick_hf_name" | "maverick_ckpt_path", default = "fynnos/maverick-mes-de10"
  device = "cpu" | "cuda", default = "cuda:0"
)
```
## Inference

### Predict
You can use model.predict() to obtain coreference predictions.
For a sample input, the model will a dictionary containing:
- `tokens`, word tokenized version of the input.
- `clusters_token_offsets`, a list of clusters containing mentions' token offsets.
- `clusters_text_mentions`, a list of clusters containing mentions in plain text.


# Citation
This work is based on the on the work "Maverick: Efficient and Accurate Coreference Resolution Defying Recent Trends" by Giuliano Martinelli, Edoardo Barba, and Roberto Navigli published at [ACL 2024 main conference](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.722.pdf).
It uses their implementation forked from the [original repository](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/maverick-coref) with some adaptions to a) make it compatible with German and b) try additional model variants.
