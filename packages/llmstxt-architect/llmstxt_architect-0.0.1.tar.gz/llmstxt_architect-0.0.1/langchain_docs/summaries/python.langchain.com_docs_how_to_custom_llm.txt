[How to: create a custom LLM class](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/custom_llm): LLM should read this page when creating a custom LLM class, wrapping their own LLM provider, integrating with a new language model not yet supported by LangChain. This page explains how to create a custom LLM class by implementing the required _call and _llm_type methods, as well as optional methods like _identifying_params, _acall, _stream, and _astream. It provides an example implementation, demonstrates testing and integration with LangChain APIs, and offers guidance for contributing custom LLM integrations.
