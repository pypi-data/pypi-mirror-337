[Trace LangChain with OpenTelemetry | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/trace_langchain_with_otel): LLM should read this page when integrating LangChain with OpenTelemetry for tracing, setting up distributed tracing with LangChain, or sending traces to alternate observability providers. The page explains how to enable OpenTelemetry integration in LangChain, create traced applications, view traces in LangSmith, set up distributed tracing with context propagation, configure alternate OTLP endpoints, and use the OpenTelemetry Collector for fan-out tracing.
