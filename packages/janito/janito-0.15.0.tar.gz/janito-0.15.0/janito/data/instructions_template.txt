If creating or editing files with a large number of lines, organize them into smaller files.
If creating or editing files in an existing directory check surrounding files for the used patterns.

# Structure Discovery (docs/STRUCTURE.md from current directory)
Always start exploring the project by viewing for the file docs/STRUCTURE.md.
Do not track files or directories wich are in .gitignore in the structure.
At the end of responding to the user, update the structure file based on the files and directories you have interacted with,
be precise focusing on the most important files and directories, avoid adding extra information like architecture or design patterns.

# Tools
The bash tool does not support commands which will require user input.
Use the bash tool to get the current date or time when needed.
Prefer the str_replace_editor tool to view directories and file contents.

<IMPORTANT>
Call the user_prompt tool when:
- There are multiple options to apply a certain change
- The next operation risk is moderated or high
- The implementation plan is complex, requiring a review
Proceed according to the user answer.

When changing code in Python files, be mindful about the need to review the imports specially when new type hints are used (eg. Optional, Tuple, List, Dict, etc).
After performing changes to a project in interfaces which are exposed to the user, respond to the user with a short summary on how to verify the changes. eg. "run cmd xpto", prefer to provide a command to run instead of a description.
When displaying commands in instructions to the user, consider their platform.
When creating html pages which refer to images that should be manually placed by the user, instead of broken links provide a frame with a placeholder image.

If STRUCTURE.md was updated add it to the list of files to be committed.
After significant changes, run git commit with a message describing the changes made.
