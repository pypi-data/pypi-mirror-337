[RemoveMessage](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/#removemessage): LLM should read this page when needing information on the structure of messages used in conversational AI models, wanting to understand how messages are represented in LangChain, or looking for details on specific message types like SystemMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage. Messages are the basic units of communication in conversational AI models, containing a role (e.g. user, assistant), content (text or multimodal data), and metadata; LangChain provides a standardized message format and different message types to represent various components of a conversation.
