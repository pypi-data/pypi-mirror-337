# Environment File Operations

## Summary
Implement robust file operations for reading, parsing, and writing the .env file in the settings editor.

## Description
This task focuses on the backend functionality for safely manipulating the .env file, ensuring that changes are properly saved and the file format is preserved.

## User Story
[US001 - Environment Settings Editor](../userstories/done/US001-Settings-Editor.md)

## Technical Requirements
- Create a parser for .env files that preserves comments and formatting
- Implement a safe writing mechanism that prevents data loss
- Create backup functionality before making changes
- Handle missing or malformed .env files gracefully
- Support validation of key-value pairs
- Handle special characters and multi-line values correctly
- Implement error handling for file operations

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a function to parse .env files into a structured format
2. Implement a function to write changes back to the .env file
3. Add validation for environment variable names and values
4. Create backup functionality
5. Implement error handling for file operations
6. Add support for creating a new .env file if none exists
7. Add support for templates based on .env_template

## Definition of Done
- .env files can be loaded and parsed correctly
- Comments and formatting are preserved when saving
- Backups are created before destructive operations
- Error handling prevents data loss
- Special characters and multi-line values are handled correctly
- Missing .env files are handled gracefully

## Dependencies
- Python's os, io, and shutil modules
- Optional: python-dotenv library (if appropriate)
