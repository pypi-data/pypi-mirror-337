    """
    Production-ready UDPSender for transmitting encrypted packets over UDP.
    This class wraps a network abstraction (which must provide a `transmit` method)
    and enhances it with retry logic, context management, and structured logging.

    Attributes:
        network: An instance providing a `transmit(encrypted_packet: bytes) -> int` method.
        max_retries: The maximum number of retries for transient failures.
        retry_delay: Base delay (in seconds) between retries; delay increases with each attempt.

            max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts (default is 3).
