# MIS Checklist

**Created by**: Spencer Smith

### Follows [writing checklist](https://github.com/ssm-lab/capstone--source-code-optimizer/blob/main/docs/Checklists/Writing-Checklist.pdf)
  - [ ] LaTeX points
  - [ ] Structure
  - [ ] Spelling, grammar, attention to detail
  - [ ] Avoid low information content phrases
  - [ ] Writing style
### MIS Module Classifications
  - [ ] Types that only hold data (records) are modelled as exported types.  For
    instance, the `StdntAllocTypes` module in [A2](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se2aa4_cs2me3/blob/master/Assignments/A2/A2.pdf)
  - [ ] Types that have data (state) and behaviour are modelled as ADTs.  The
    MIS should use the keyword +`Template`.  An example is the [BoardT ADT](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se2aa4_cs2me3/blob/master/Assignments/A3/A3Soln/A3P1_Spec.pdf)
  - [ ] Abstract objects are used when there is only one instance.  There is
    state and behaviour.  This most
    often comes up for "global" reader and writer modules.  For instance, a
    module that does logging.  Abstract objects do NOT use the word Template in
    the main header.  An example is given in the SALst module of [A2](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se2aa4_cs2me3/blob/master/Assignments/A2/A2.pdf)
  - [ ] Library modules are used when there is only behaviour, no state.  They
      are defined as Modules, but State Variables and Environment Variable
      fields say "None."
  - [ ] If the module's MIS can be parameterized by type, then the keyword
    `Generic` is used.  Generic modules are usually also Template
    modules, but not necessarily.  An example is given in the Generic Stack
    Module (Stack(T)) given in [A3](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se2aa4_cs2me3/blob/master/Assignments/A3/A3Soln/A3P1_Spec.pdf)
  - [ ] Abstract objects will have some kind of initialization method
  - [ ] Abstract objects will have an assumptions that programmers will
      initialize first, or a state variable that is set from False to True when
      the Abstract object is initialized - this state variable then needs to be
      checked for each access program call

### MIS and Mathematical syntax
  - [ ] Exported constants are "hard-coded" literal values, not variables.
    Constants are values that are known at specification (and therefore compile)
    time.  Explicit constant values are provided in the MIS, not left to be
    filled in later.  (They can be changed later, but specific values should be given.)
  - [ ] Operations do not mix incorrect types.  For instance, a character is not
    added to an integer, an integer is not "anded" with a Boolean, etc.
  - [ ] Our [modified Hoffmann and Strooper notation](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se2aa4_cs2me3/-/blob/master/MISFormat/MISFormat.pdf) is used, or any new notation is
    clearly defined.

### MIS Semantics for each module
  - [ ] Each access program does something either an output, or a state
    transition
  - [ ] Access programs either change the state of something, or have an output.
    Only rarely should an access program do both (as it does for the constructor
    in an ADT.)
  - [ ] If there is an entry in the state transition, then the state of
    something changes.  The state change might be the local state variables, the
    state variables for another module, or an environment variable.
  - [ ] Outputs use $out := ...$
  - [ ] Exceptions use $exc := ...$
  - [ ] If the state invariant is satisfied before an access program call, it
    will remain satisfied after the call
  - [ ] State invariant is initially satisfied
  - [ ] Local functions make the specification easier to read (there is no
    requirement that the local functions will actually be implemented in code)
  - [ ] Modules that deal with files, the keyboard, or the screen, have
    environment variables to represent these respective entitites
  - [ ] Symbols are from SRS - not yet translated to code names (that is use
    $\theta$, not `theta`)

### MIS Quality inspection for each module
  - [ ] Consistent
  - [ ] Essential
  - [ ] General
  - [ ] Implementation independent
  - [ ] Minimal
  - [ ] High cohesion
  - [ ] Opaque (information hiding)

### MIS Completeness
  - [ ] All types introduced in the spec are defined somewhere
  - [ ] All modules in MG are in the MIS
  - [ ] All required sections of the template are present for all modules
