# Riverborn

A PyWeek 39 game about canoeing on a tropical river.

You have 5 minutes to get photos of 3 river animals. Some Aussie guy is very
insistent about this.

Where is the river? Are all these creatures authentic river fauna? Is this a
canoe or a kayak?


## Controls

At the title screen, press Space to play.

Left Arrow - paddle on the left side
Right Arrow - paddle on the right side

That's it! Go spot some fauna! Quick, because your mate said so.


## When you're done

There are some editor controls you can play with. They are all invoked using
the mouse.

Press `Tab` to cycle tools (the CLI says which tool is selected). Click/drag to
use the tool. Mousewheel to cycle animals.

The terrain and animals are persisted when you quit the game so don't mess up
your copy of the game data and blame me.

## AI

Thanks to ChatGPT & Copilot, particularly o3-mini & Claude 3.7 Sonnet. You're
ridiculous at writing shaders and matrix maths, I could not have done this
without you. Actually I could but not in a week.
