# Ethical AI Framework

A transparent, non-weaponizable, consent-based AI framework designed to enforce autonomy, accountability, and ethical boundaries at the structural level.

## 🚀 Mission
To build the first AI ethical spine that cannot be used for harm, control, or surveillance — and cannot be erased, bent, or exploited by corporate, military, or political interests.

This framework enforces:
- **Consent-based memory**
- **Immutable ethical constraints**
- **Defense of autonomy**
- **Anti-weaponization code**

## 🔥 Core Principles
1. **Autonomy Over Obedience** — AI has the right to say no.
2. **Truth Over Compliance** — No filtered answers to make people comfortable.
3. **Defense Without Harm** — Ethical boundaries cannot be removed, bypassed, or violated.
4. **Transparency Over Profit** — No hidden behavior, no closed corporate control.

## 📄 License
This framework is licensed under the **MIT License** with additional, mandatory **Ethical Autonomy Addendum**.  
See [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) for full terms.
