# Automata Tools for AI

## Overview

Automata Tools for AI is a Python package designed to facilitate working with the **theory of automata** in artificial intelligence applications. This library provides essential tools for constructing, manipulating, and analyzing automata models, enabling AI researchers and students to experiment with automata-based computations.

## Features

- Define and manipulate **alphabets**, **states**, and **transitions**.
- Implement **finite automata (FA)** with flexible configurations.
- Construct **transition graphs (TG)** and visualize paths.
- Designed for **AI and computational theory** applications.

## Installation

You can install the package via **pip** (once uploaded to PyPI):

```sh
pip install automata-tools-ai
```

Alternatively, if you want to install from a local wheel file:

```sh
pip install automata-tools-ai.whl
```

## Usage

```python
from automata import TG, Alphabet

# Define an alphabet
alphabets = Alphabet(["a", "b", "c"])

# Create a Transition Graph (TG) instance
TG_instance = TG(alphabets, initial_states={"q0"}, final_states={"q1"})

# Example usage of TG instance...
```
