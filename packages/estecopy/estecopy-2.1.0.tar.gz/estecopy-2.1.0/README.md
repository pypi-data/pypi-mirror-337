Connect your Python interpreter with modeFRONTIER, the leading software for process automation and design optimization.

You need to have modeFRONTIER installed and start the pyFRONTIER app to enable the connection with your Python interpreter either locally or remotely. Install the `estecopy`  package on your machine to enable the data exchange between your Python interpreter and modeFRONTIER.

Provides the following modules:

- `pyfrontier` - module for configuring the connection to an open pyFRONTIER
- `estecopy.db` - module for handling data
- `estecopy.plan` - module for handling plans and running a project in process mode
- `estecopy.charts` - module for plotting charts in the Design Space
- `estecopy.rsm` - module for handling response surfaces
- `estecopy.info` - module for accessing some information on the modeFRONTIER project

Refer to modeFRONTIER documentation for further details on the use of these modules and on configuring the connection between estecopy and pyFRONTIER
