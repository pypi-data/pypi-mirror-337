closeformik is an analytical inverse kinematics calculation library for a 6-DOF robotic arm. When solving for inverse kinematics, please call the CIK function. The input to the function is eeTform (end-effector flange position), MdhParams (DH parameter table: d, a, alpha, theta), jointlimits (joint angle limits), joint_ref (reference joint angles): A typical application example is: 

from cik import CIK

MdhParams = np.array([
    [a1,    alpha1,     d1,     theta1],
    [a2,    alpha2,     d2,     theta2],
    [a3,    alpha3,     d3,     theta3],
    [a4,    alpha4,     d4,     theta4],
    [a5,    alpha5,     d5,     theta5],
    [a6,    alpha6,     d6,     theta6]
])

Jointlimits = [
    [limit_n_j1, limit_p_j1],  # Joint 1
    [limit_n_j2, limit_p_j2],  # Joint 2
    [limit_n_j3, limit_p_j3],   # Joint 3
    [limit_n_j4, limit_p_j4],  # Joint 4
    [limit_n_j5, limit_p_j5],   # Joint 5
    [limit_n_j6, limit_p_j6]   # Joint 6
]

sol = CIK(eeTform, MdhParams, Jointlimits, joint_ref=joint_ref)
