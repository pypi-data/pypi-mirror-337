# The NekoMimi PyModule  
This is my "one size fits all" module that helps you do all sorts of repetative and/or useful but hard to manage tasks  
From checking website uptime to working with data in a registry or manually and dynamically loading modules  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All versions above v1.1.0 wont change or deprecate features no matter the numbers of versions the come  
> However prior to v1.1.0 every release has a breaking change so it's advised not to use them and only stick with v1.3.0+  

# Building  
NekoMimi is built using bob:  
1. make sure you dont have the module already installed  
2. clone and install [bob](https://github.com/NekoMimiOfficial/Bob)  
3. run `bob` in the root folder of this repository (after you cloned it)  
4. install the wheel found in `dist/`  

# Docs  
Documentations and examples for all the different features are found at the [docs](https://github.com/NekoMimiOfficial/NekoMimi/blob/main/Docs/README.md)  
They are simple to understand and should get you up and running in no time :3
