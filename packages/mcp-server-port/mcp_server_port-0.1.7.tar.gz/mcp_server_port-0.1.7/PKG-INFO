# Port MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the [Port.io API](https://www.getport.io/), enabling Claude to interact with Port.io's developer platform capabilities using natural language.

## What You Can Do With Port MCP

Transform how you work with Port.io using natural language:

### Find Information Quickly
- **Get entity details** - "Who is the owner of service X?"
- **Check on-call status** - "Who is on call right now?"
- **Get catalog insights** - "How many services do we have in production?"

### Analyze Scorecards 
- **Identify weak points** - "Which services are failing for the gold level and why?"
- **Get compliance status** - "Show me all services that don't meet our security requirements"
- **Improve quality** - "What do I need to fix to reach the next scorecard level?"

### Create Resources
- **Build scorecards** - "Create a new scorecard called 'Security Posture' with levels Basic, Silver, and Gold"
- **Define rules** - "Add a rule that requires services to have a team owner to reach the Silver level"
- **Setup quality gates** - "Create a rule that checks if services have proper documentation"

We're continuously expanding Port MCP's capabilities. Have a suggestion? We'd love to hear your feedback on our [roadmap](https://roadmap.getport.io/ideas)!

## Installation

### Obtain your Port credentials
1. Create a Port.io Account:
   - Visit [Port.io](https://www.port.io/)
   - Sign up for an account if you don't have one

2. Create an API Key:
   - Navigate to your Port.io dashboard
   - Go to Settings > Credentials
   - Save both the Client ID and Client Secret

### Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "port": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-port@0.1.4",
        "--client-id", "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "--client-secret", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "--region", "REGION" # US or EU
      ]
    }
  }
} 
```

### Cursor

1. Make sure `uvx` is installed:
```bash
pip install uvx
```

2. Get its location:
```bash
which uvx
# Example output: /Users/janedoe/.local/bin/uvx
```

3. Create a script to run the server:
```bash
# run-port-mcp.sh

cd /Users/janedoe/.local/bin/uvx

# Run the server with the specified credentials
./.venv/bin/uvx mcp-server-port@0.1.4 --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET --region YOUR_REGION
```

4. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/file/run-port-mcp.sh
```

5. Configure in Cursor settings:
   - Go to Cursor settings > MCP Servers
   - Configure with:
     * Name - `Port`
     * Type - `Command`
     * Command - `/path/to/your/file/run-port-mcp.sh`
