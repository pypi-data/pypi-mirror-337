    The :func:`.generate_cutting_experiments` function now performs
    some optimizations on the generated circuits before returning them
    to the user.  In particular, it performs the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveResetInZeroState`,
    :class:`.RemoveFinalReset`, and :class:`.ConsolidateResets`
    passes, so that circuits with cut wires and no re-used qubits are
    transformed into subexperiments that contain no
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.Reset`\ s.  This allows such circuits to
    work on a greater variety of hardware backends.
