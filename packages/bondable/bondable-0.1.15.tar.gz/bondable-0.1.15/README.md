# Bond AI

Bond AI leverages OpenAI's Assistant APi to help develop Generative AI agents and chatbots with access to your own tools, APIs and data sources. Bond AI also has a web UI with a built-in chat interface and is extensible to other interfaces with access to these agents. 


## Features

- Simple definition of agents with tools and data
- Automatic discovery of agents
- Built-in threads, tool access and data integration from the Assistants API
- Google authentication support
- Thread sharing between users
- Modular design with agents, threads, and pages

## Getting Started
