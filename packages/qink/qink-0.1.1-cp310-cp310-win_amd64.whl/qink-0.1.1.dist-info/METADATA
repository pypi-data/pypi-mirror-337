# qink - Real-time data processing framework

<img src="logo.png" alt="Qink Logo" >

A Cython-based data pipeline project.

## Development Setup

```
# Windows
set PYTHONPATH=.

# Linux/macOS
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build the Cython modules:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all tests and generate a coverage report. The coverage report will show which parts of the code are covered by tests.

To run tests with more detailed output:

```bash
pytest -v
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_fib.py
```

To run tests in watch mode (automatically re-runs tests when files change):

```bash
ptw
```

You can also use additional options with watch mode:

```bash
ptw -- -v  # Verbose output
ptw -- -k "test_name"  # Run tests matching the given name
```
