[How to: save and load LangChain objects](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/serialization): LLM should read this page when needing to save and reload LangChain objects, handle API keys securely when serializing/deserializing objects, and maintain compatibility when deserializing objects across different versions of LangChain. This page discusses how to save and load serializable LangChain objects like chains, messages, and documents using the dump/load functions, which separate API keys and ensure cross-version compatibility. Examples are provided for serializing/deserializing to JSON strings, Python dicts, and disk files.
