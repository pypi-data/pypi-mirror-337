SentimentX is an advanced sentiment analysis Python library that combines multiple sentiment detection techniques, including lexicon-based, emotion detection, and deep learning models, to provide a comprehensive analysis of text sentiment.

-> Features:

1. Lexicon-based Analysis: Uses predefined sentiment lexicons to determine sentiment scores.

2. Emotion Detection: Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

3. Deep Learning Models: Leverages transformer-based models for context-aware sentiment classification.

4. Multilingual Support: Supports sentiment analysis in multiple languages.

5. Emoji & Slang Handling: Understands modern-day text including emojis and internet slang.

-> Installation:

pip install sentimentx

-> Usage:

from sentimentx.sentiment import analyze_sentiment

# Sample text
text = "I am really happy today! This is the best day of my life ðŸŽ‰"

# Analyze sentiment
result = analyze_sentiment(text)

# Display results
import json
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))
