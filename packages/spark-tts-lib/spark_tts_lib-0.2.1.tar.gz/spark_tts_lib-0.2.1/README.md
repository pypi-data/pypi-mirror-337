## üì¶ Install 

```bash
pip install spark-tts-lib
```

## üåü Sample Example

```python
from spark_tts_lib import SparkTTS

model = SparkTTS()
wav_data = model.inference(text="Hello, world!")
```

## üöÄ Usage

**Download the pretrained model:**

```python
from spark_tts_lib import download_pretrained_model

download_pretrained_model()
```

> The model will be downloaded to the `pretrained_models/Spark-TTS-0.5B` directory in the current directory. You can also specify a directory to save it.
> 
> ```python
> download_pretrained_model(local_dir="/path/to/save/model")
> ```
> You can also download the model from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS-0.5B) page.

**Import SparkTTS:**

```python
from spark_tts_lib import SparkTTS
```

**Initialize the model:**

```python
model = SparkTTS()
```

> If you want to specify the model directory, you can do it like this:
> 
> ```python
> model_dir = "pretrained_models/Spark-TTS-0.5B"
> model = SparkTTS(model_dir)
> ```

**Perform voice creation inference:**

```python
text = "This is the text you want to synthesize into speech."
gender = "female" # "male"
pitch = "high" # "very_low" | "low" | "moderate" | "high" | "very_high"
speed = "high" # "very_low" | "low" | "moderate" | "high" | "very_high"

wav_data = model.inference(text=text, gender=gender, pitch=pitch, speed=speed)
```

**Perform voice cloning inference:**

```python
text = "This is the text you want to synthesize into speech."
prompt_speech_path = "prompt_audio.wav"
prompt_text = "This is the text corresponding to your reference audio."

wav_data = model.inference(
    text=text,
    prompt_speech_path=prompt_speech_path,
    prompt_text=prompt_text,
)
```

**Inference with more parameters:**

```python
model.inference(
    ...
    temperature=0.8,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
)
```
