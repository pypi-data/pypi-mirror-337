Locate the Setting
- Open an invoice and go to the "Other Information" tab.

Toggle the Checkbox
- You will see a checkbox labeled "Show Commercial Entity." This field is not active by default. It will be automatically activated or deactivated depending on whether the partner differs from its commercial entity.
- When active, the invoice will display the commercial address (the parent company’s address) near the invoice subtotal, in addition to the usual billing contact address.
- For a particular invoice, if you do not want to display the commercial address—even when a different billing address is set—you can manually change this option.
