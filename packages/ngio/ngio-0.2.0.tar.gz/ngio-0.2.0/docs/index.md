NGIO is a Python library designed to simplify bio-image analysis workflows, offering an intuitive interface for working with OME-Zarr files.

## What is NGIO?

NGIO is built for the [OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) file format, a modern, cloud-optimized format for biological imaging data. OME-Zarr stores large, multi-dimensional microscopy images and metadata in an efficient and scalable way.

NGIO's mission is to streamline working with OME-Zarr files by providing a simple, object-based API for opening, exploring, and manipulating OME-Zarr Images and HCS Plates. It also offers comprehensive support for tables and regions of interest (ROIs), making it easy to extract and analyze specific regions in your data.

## Key Features

### üìä Simple Object-Based API

- Easily open, explore, and manipulate OME-Zarr Images and HCS Plates
- Create and derive new images and labels with minimal boilerplate code

### üîç Rich Tables and Regions of Interest (ROI) Support

- Extract and analyze specific regions of interest
- Tight integration with [Fractal's Table Framework](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/tables/)

### üîÑ Scalable Data Processing (Coming Soon)

- Powerful iterators for processing data at scale
- Efficient memory management for large datasets

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Getting Started](getting_started/0_quickstart.md) guide to integrate NGIO into your workflows. We also provide a collection of [tutorials](tutorials/image_processing.ipynb) to help you get up and running quickly.
For more advanced usage and API documentation, see our [API Reference](api/ngio.md).
