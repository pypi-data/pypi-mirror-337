[](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/callbacks_attach/): LLM should read this page when: 1) Attaching callbacks to a chain to run for all nested module runs 2) Reusing callbacks across multiple executions of a chain 3) Binding callbacks to avoid passing them in for each invocation 'This page explains how to attach callbacks (e.g. ConsoleCallbackHandler) to a chain using the withConfig() method, allowing callbacks to be reused across multiple executions without needing to pass them in each time. It also mentions that bound callbacks will run for nested module runs within the chain.'
