    Added a workaround so that the classical registers in the
    generated circuits will always contain at least one bit.  This is
    currently necessary for the experiments to be able to reach IBM
    Quantum's hardware backends due to an `openqasm parser issue
    <https://github.com/openqasm/qe-qasm/issues/37>`__.
