[How to integrate LangGraph with AutoGen, CrewAI, and other frameworks](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-integration/): LLM should read this page when integrating LangGraph with other agent frameworks, building multi-agent systems, or adding persistence features to agents. The page demonstrates how to combine LangGraph with AutoGen by calling AutoGen agents inside LangGraph nodes, showing code examples for setting up the integration with memory and conversation persistence.
