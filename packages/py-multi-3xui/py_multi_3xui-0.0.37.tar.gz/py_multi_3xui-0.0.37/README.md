
# multi_3x_ui
A tool for managing multiple 3x-ui panels at once.
## Overview
This module is based on [py3xui](https://github.com/iwatkot/py3xui).\
Used dependencies:
-  `py3xui` for connecting and managing 3xui panels
- - `py3xui` dependencies:
- - `requests` for synchronous API
- - `httpx` for asynchronous API
- - `pydantic` for models
-  `six` (I just cannot make py3xui work without a last version of six. This will be fixed in next versions)

Supported Python Versions:
-  `3.11 `
-  `3.12 `

3x-ui is under development. py3xui also. I am not related with 3x-ui or py3xui. But the module supports py3xui>=0.3.4(and all version of 3x-ui that are being supported by py3xui)
# Quick Start
### Installation
 ```bash
pip install py_multi_3xui
```

## Operating with servers

### Adding server to database

```python
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py_multi_3xui import ServerDataManager

username = "Ben"
password = "BenLoveApples123"
host = "https://benserver.com:PORT/PATH/"
secret_token = "very_secret_token"
internet_speed = 5  # amount in gb per second.
location = "usa"
# to add a server to db you need to create an instance of server
server = Server(username=username, password=password, host=host, location=location, secret_token=secret_token,
                internet_speed=internet_speed)
data_manager = ServerDataManager()
# after first call ServerDataManager.__init__() the servers.db will be created(if it already exists, it won't be created)
data_manager.add_server(server)
```

some notes:
- *Learn your server's traffic speed by using [Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/) or ask your VPS seller. This is used to calculate a comfortable amount of users per server*
- *note, that there is no filtration by valid country code. You can add whatever location that you want(maybe will be improved)*

### Deleting server from database

```python
from py_multi_3xui import ServerDataManager

host = "some_server.com:PORT/PATH/"
manager = ServerDataManager()
manager.delete_server(host)
```
### Get best server by country

```python
from py_multi_3xui import ServerDataManager

manager = ServerDataManager()
country = "usa"
best_server = await manager.choose_best_server_by_country("usa")
print(best_server.__str__())
```
## Working with clients/configs
### Generate client (not add)
```python
server = ...
# 1. Create client by yourself

from py3xui import Client

client = Client()

# 2. Create client using server.generate_client
from py_multi_3xui import RandomStuffGenerator as rsg

total_gb = 30  # max amount of traffic that can be used
inbound_id = 4  # client's inbound id
limit_ip = 0  # max amount of clients IP's. If set to zero, there is no limit
client_email = rsg.generate_email(10)  # client's email. Must be unique
expiry_time = 30# expiry time in days. If set to zero, there is no limit
up = 0# a limit for upnload speed. If set to zero, there is no limit
down = 0# a limit for download speed. If set to zero, there is no limit
client = server.generate_client(total_gb=total_gb,
                                inbound_id=inbound_id,
                                limit_ip=limit_ip,
                                client_email=client_email,
                                expiry_time=expiry_time,
                                up=up,
                                down=down)  # note, this method is static
```

### Add client to server
```python
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py3xui import Client
server = ...
client = ...
server.add_client(client)
```
### Get connection string
```python
from py_multi_3xui import Server
from py3xui import Client
server = ...
client = ...
config = server.get_config(client)
```
### Delete client by uuid
```python
server = ...
uuid = "27b7a601-31d9-42af-8f74-4511092af5d4"
inbound_id = 4
server.delete_client_by_uuid(client_uuid=uuid,inbound_id=inbound_id)
```
