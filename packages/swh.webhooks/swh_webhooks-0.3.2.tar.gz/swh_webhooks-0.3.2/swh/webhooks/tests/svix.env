# Values here can also be set by setting the appropriate env var, e.g. SVIX_DB_DSN for db_dsn
# The values shown below are the default values. Values commented out are not set but recommended.

# The address to listen on
SVIX_LISTEN_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:8071"

# The address of the Svix server to use for sending operational webhooks (disabled when omitted/null)
# Operational webhooks (otherwise known as "incoming webhooks"), are webhooks
# send from the Svix server to you, to let you know when some events happen.
# For a list of supported events please refer to: https://api.svix.com/docs#tag/Webhooks

# IMPORTANT: Once set, it can't be changed.

# The JWT secret for authentication - should be secret and securely generated
SVIX_JWT_SECRET="8KjzRXrKkd9YFcNyqLSIY8JwiaCeRc6WK4UkMnSW"

# This determines the type of key that is generated for endpoint secrets by default (when none is set).
# Supported: hmac256 (default), ed25519
# Note: this does not affect existing keys, which will continue signing based on the type they were created with.

# The log level to run the service with. Supported: info, debug, trace
SVIX_LOG_LEVEL="info"
# The log format that all output will follow. Supported: default, json
SVIX_LOG_FORMAT="default"

# The OpenTelemetry address to send trace information to. Disabled when omitted/null.
# opentelemetry_address="http://localhost:4317"

# The ratio at which to sample spans when sending to OpenTelemetry. When not given it defaults to
# always sending. If the OpenTelemetry address is not set, this will do nothing.

# The DSN for the database. Only postgres is currently supported.

# specific DSNs)

# What kind of message queue to use. Supported: memory, redis, rediscluster
# Redis backends must have a redis_dsn or queue_dsn configured, and it's highly recommended to
# enable persistence in redis so that a server restart doesn't wipe the queue.
SVIX_QUEUE_TYPE="redis"

# The DSN for the Redis-backed queue. Overrides `redis_dsn`. (can be left empty if not using redis)
# queue_dsn="redis://redis:6379"

# What kind of cache to use. Supported: memory, redis, rediscluster, none.
# Redis backends must have a redis_dsn or cache_dsn configured.
# The memory backend is recommended if you only have one instance running (not including workers). If you have
# multiple API servers running, please use the redis backend or some functionality, (e.g. Idempotency)
# may fail to work correctly.

# Subnets to whitelist for outbound webhooks. Note that allowing endpoints in private IP space
# is a security risk and should only be allowed if you are using the service internally or for
