### Remove

- removes files
- prints out filepath
- logs filepath to syslog
- optionally, logs to sqlite database

### Motivation

- being able to clean up folders deep inside tree: `remove **/node_nodules`
- we could do this via normal `rm -rf **/node_nodules`, however we would not see what entries being removed
- `rm` command has `-v` option to display removed entry. And we could use `rm -frv **/node_modules`.
  But `rm` would log each file in this case. For a large `node_modules` - the output is overwhelming.
  I just need to see which node_modules being removed and keep the output log readable.
- we could use `find` and `xargs` - but we will end up with rather longer command for a `trivial` task

### Example

```bash
pip install ngm-remove
cd projects

remove **/node_nodules

journalctl -t remove
```
