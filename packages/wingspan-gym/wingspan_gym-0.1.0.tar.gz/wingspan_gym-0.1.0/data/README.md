# Data used for development

There are a few resources I based this version of game off of.
The one that is used by *code_gen/* scripts is 2022-12-01 from [thread on BoardGameGeek forum](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193164/wingspan-spreadsheet-bird-cards-bonus-cards-end-of). It should be downloaded, and placed in this folder.

Additionally, sometimes I double-checked info with [WingSearch](https://navarog.github.io/wingsearch/) or my own version of the game.
