A neural machine translation system framework that automatically learns and translates natural languages and constructed languages (conlangs) based on a small set of translation examples. This project uses transfer learning with pre-trained language models to achieve high-quality translations with minimal training data.

![Showcase](docs/showcase.png)

In the example above, **T5** learned a language with only 45 examples via transfer learning and augmentation techniques provided by **ALF** framework. The model has also shown positive results for big datasets, as can be seen below on a training task for Portuguese to English questions translation (*special thanks to [Paulo Pirozelli's Pirá: A Bilingual Portuguese-English Dataset for Question-Answering about the Ocean, the Brazilian coast, and climate change](https://huggingface.co/datasets/paulopirozelli/pira)*)

## Hardware

**ALF-T5** was tested on a diverse range of hardware, which has helped a lot on understanding the capabilities of the system and its problems. Luckily, there were more good surprises than problems, but improvement is never a waste of time, so it will be key to keep improving **ALF-T5**'s architecture.

The hardware in which it was tested was:

- ![T4](https://img.shields.io/badge/NVIDIA-T4-76B900?logo=nvidia&logoColor=white) - Used during early development, specially on the architecture without learning transfer. Yielded some good insights on performance and capability;
- ![TPU v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-TPU%20v2-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&color=525252): Also used during early development, but was the first to be used on the learning transfer architecture. Was key to understand the final shape of the system's architecture;
- ![A40](https://img.shields.io/badge/NVIDIA-A40-76B900?logo=nvidia&logoColor=white): Yielded awesome insights on later development, as it was used to test T5-Small and T5-Base, the first base models to grant SoTA performance;
- ![A100](https://img.shields.io/badge/NVIDIA-A100-76B900?logo=nvidia&logoColor=white): The most powerful and important hardware used in development, could handle many tests and really yielded key insights to understand data structure and how the model was using it to leverage performance.

## Quick Start

### Training a New Translator

#### Important note about T5-Large

> [!NOTE]
If choosing to use **T5-Large** as the base for **ALF**, it is known that it's not possible to use **FP16** due to a problem with **T5ForConditionalGeneration** (You can [check this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/10830) to learn more about it), so it's **required** to disable **FP16** on **ALFT5Translator** in order to train it, otherwise it will have **NaN** loss on `train_loss` and a constant `val_loss`.

```python
from alf_t5 import ALFT5Translator, extract_dataset

# Example language data
# .txt, .csv
data = extract_dataset("my_data.txt")
# Create and train translator
translator = ALFT5Translator(
    model_name="t5-small",
    use_peft=True,
    batch_size=4,
    num_epochs=20,
    output_dir="alf_t5_translator"
)

# Train the model
translator.train(
    data_string=data,
    test_size=0.2,
    augment=True
)
```

### Important information regarding training

After training your language (either conlang or natural language), you will notice that it has a validation loss value (`val_loss`), if you don't know how to interpret it, the table below explains what it could mean, it may vary, but it's mostly something close to the values on the table:

| Loss Range | Interpretation | Translation Quality
|-----|-----|-----
| > 3.0 | Poor convergence | Mostly incorrect translations
| 2.0 - 3.0 | Basic learning | Captures some words but grammatically incorrect
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Good learning | Understandable translations with some errors
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Very good | Mostly correct translations
| < 0.5 | Excellent | Near-perfect translations

If you constantly train the language and the values doesn't improve or the `val_loss` remain stuck on a single value, it usually means that your language dataset needs more data and the model isn't able to learn any further (it has a limit too!).

> [!TIP]
> **Target validation loss**: Aim for **0.8-1.5** with a small dataset (30-100 examples). It may be easier for languages with a more clear structure, but languages like Na'vi are usually harder for **ALF-T5** to learn.
> 
> **Early stopping patience**: Set to 5-10 epochs, as loss may plateau before improving again
>
>**Overfitting signals**:
>- Training loss much lower than validation loss (gap > 0.5)
>- Validation loss decreasing then increasing
>
>**Underfitting signals**:
>- Both losses remain high (> 2.0)
>- Losses decrease very slowly
>
>If **overfit**: The model may be learning well, but has few data. This >indicates that the language is easy to learn.
>
>If **underfit**: The model may be struggling to learn, more data is needed. >This indicates that the language is hard to learn.

#### BLEU Score

The BLEU score is a number between zero and one that measures the similarity of the machine-translated text to a set of high quality reference translations. This score is applied to your natural language/conlang automatically during training if enabled by `eval_bleu` at `ALFT5Translator`. It usually means:

| BLEU Score | Interpretation | Translation Quality |
|-----|-----|-----
| < 0.1 | Poor | Translations are mostly incorrect or nonsensical. |
| < 0.2 | Fair | Some words are translated correctly, but grammar is incorrect. |
| < 0.3 | Moderate | Translations are understandable but contain significant errors. |
| < 0.4 | Good | Translations are mostly correct with some minor errors. |
| < 0.5 | Very Good | Translations are fluent and accurate with few errors. |
| > 0.5 | Excellent | Translations are nearly perfect. |

You can also do the following:

```python
from alf_t5 import interpret_bleu_score

interpret_bleu_score(0.6961, 100)
```

```
{'score': 0.6961,
 'quality': 'Excellent',
 'description': 'Translations are nearly perfect.',
 'context': 'For a medium dataset of 100 examples, this is Excellent.'}
```

#### METEOR Score

The METEOR score is another evaluation metric that often correlates better with human judgment than BLEU. It takes into account word-to-word matches, including stemming and synonymy matching. This score is applied to your language automatically during training if enabled by `eval_meteor` at `ALFT5Translator`.

| METEOR Score | Interpretation | Translation Quality |
|-----|-----|-----
| < 0.20 | Poor | Translations are mostly incorrect or nonsensical. |
| < 0.30 | Fair | Some words are translated correctly, but grammar is incorrect. |
| < 0.40 | Moderate | Translations are understandable but contain significant errors. |
| < 0.50 | Good | Translations are mostly correct with some minor errors. |
| < 0.60 | Very Good | Translations are fluent and accurate with few errors. |
| > 0.60 | Excellent | Translations are nearly perfect. |

You can interpret METEOR scores similarly to BLEU:

```python
from alf_t5 import interpret_meteor_score

interpret_meteor_score(0.7522, 100)
```

```
{'score': 0.7522,
 'quality': 'Excellent',
 'description': 'Translations are nearly perfect.',
 'context': 'For a medium dataset of 100 examples, this is Excellent.'}
```

### Model Architecture Experimentation

ALF-T5 includes a framework for experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters. This allows you to find the optimal configuration for your specific language translation task:

```python
from alf_t5 import ModelExperiment

# Initialize the experiment framework
experiment = ModelExperiment(
    base_output_dir="my_experiments",
    data_file="my_language_data.txt",
    test_size=0.2,
    augment=True,
    metrics=["bleu", "meteor"]
)

# Add a baseline experiment
experiment.add_experiment(
    name="baseline",
    model_name="t5-small",
    num_epochs=20,
    batch_size=16
)

# Try different configurations with grid search
experiment.add_grid_search(
    name_prefix="peft_config",
    model_names=["t5-small"],
    peft_r=[4, 8, 16],
    learning_rate=[1e-4, 3e-4]
)

# Run all experiments
results_df = experiment.run_experiments()

# Get the best experiment
best_exp = experiment.get_best_experiment(metric="meteor_score", higher_is_better=True)
print(f"Best experiment: {best_exp['name']}")

# Plot results
experiment.plot_experiment_results()
```

See `model_experiment_example.py` for a complete example.

### Testing

ALF-T5 includes a comprehensive test suite that validates key functionality:

```shellscript
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py

# Run specific test module
python tests/run_tests.py test_metrics.py
```

### Testing The Translator

```python
# Basic translation
english = translator.translate("thou drinkth waterth", direction="c2e")
target_language = translator.translate("you drink water", direction="e2c")

print(f"English: {english}")
print(f"Target Language: {target_language}")

# Translation with confidence scores
english_translation, english_confidence = translator.translate(
    "thou drinkth waterth", 
    direction="c2e",
    return_confidence=True
)

target_translation, target_confidence = translator.translate(
    "you drink water", 
    direction="e2c",
    return_confidence=True
)

print(f"English: {english_translation} (Confidence: {english_confidence:.4f})")
print(f"Target Language: {target_translation} (Confidence: {target_confidence:.4f})")
```

### Using a Trained Translator

```python
from alf_t5 import ALFT5Translator

# Load a trained model
translator = ALFT5Translator.load("alf_t5_translator/final_model")

# Translate from the target language to English
english = translator.translate("thou eath thy appleth", direction="c2e")
print(f"English: {english}")

# Translate from English to the target language
target_language = translator.translate("I see you", direction="e2c")
print(f"Target Language: {target_language}")
```

### Interactive Mode

```shellscript
# Basic interactive mode
python alf_app.py --model alf_t5_translator/final_model --mode interactive

# Interactive mode with confidence scores
python alf_app.py --model alf_t5_translator/final_model --mode interactive --confidence
```

In interactive mode, you can also toggle confidence scores by typing:
```
confidence on  # To enable confidence scores
confidence off  # To disable confidence scores
```

## Data Format

The objective of the framework is to make the process of training a translator easier to be done. Having this in mind, the translator accepts language data in the following simplified format:

```plaintext
language_text|english_translation
```

Each line contains a pair of language text and its English translation, separated by a pipe character (`|`).

## Technical Details

### Architecture

**ALF** uses the **Google's T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model as the foundation for the translation system. **T5** is an encoder-decoder model specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation.

Key components:

- **Base Model**: T5-small (60M parameters) by default, but can be configured to use larger variants
- **Fine-Tuning**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Tokenization**: Uses T5's subword tokenizer
- **Training**: Bidirectional training (Source Language→English and English→Source Language)
- **Generation**: Beam search with configurable parameters


### Why T5 over Causal Language Models?

For language translation, T5's encoder-decoder architecture offers several advantages:

1. **Bidirectional Context**: The encoder processes the entire source sentence bidirectionally
2. **Parameter Efficiency**: More efficient for translation tasks than causal LMs
3. **Training Stability**: More stable during fine-tuning for translation tasks
4. **Resource Requirements**: Requires less computational resources

### Data Augmentation

To maximize learning from limited examples, the system employs several data augmentation techniques:

1. **Case Variations**: Adding capitalized versions of examples
2. **Word Order Variations**: Adding reversed word order for multi-word phrases
3. **Vocabulary Recombination**: Creating new combinations from existing vocabulary mappings

> This is still a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Training Process

The training process involves:

1. **Data Parsing**: Converting the input format into training pairs
2. **Data Augmentation**: Expanding the training data
3. **Tokenization**: Converting text to token IDs
4. **Model Initialization**: Loading the pre-trained T5 model
5. **PEFT Setup**: Configuring LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
6. **Training Loop**: Fine-tuning with early stopping based on validation loss
7. **Model Saving**: Saving checkpoints and the final model

### Training Parameters

Key parameters that can be configured:

- `model_name`: Base pre-trained model (default: "t5-small")
- `use_peft`: Whether to use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (default: True)
- `peft_r`: LoRA rank (default: 8)
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training (default: 8)
- `lr`: Learning rate (default: 5e-4)
- `num_epochs`: Maximum number of training epochs (default: 20)
- `max_length`: Maximum sequence length (default: 128)

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Translation

```python
texts = ["thou eath", "thou walkth toth", "Ith eath thy appleth"]
directions = ["c2e", "c2e", "c2e"]

app = ALFTranslatorApp("alf_t5_translator/final_model")
results = app.batch_translate(texts, directions)

for result in results:
    print(f"Source: {result['source']}")
    print(f"Translation: {result['translation']}")
```

### File Translation

```shellscript
python alf_app.py --model alf_t5_translator/final_model --mode file --input input.txt --output output.txt --direction c2e
```

## Performance Considerations

- **GPU Acceleration**: Training and inference are significantly faster with a GPU
- **Model Size**: Larger T5 models (t5-base, t5-large) may provide better results but require more resources
- **Training Data**: More diverse examples generally lead to better generalization
- **Hyperparameters**: Adjust batch size, learning rate, and LoRA parameters based on your dataset size
