[How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/multi-agent-multi-turn-convo/): LLM should read this page when implementing multi-turn conversations between agents, creating interactive agent systems with human input, or learning about langgraph interrupts and agent handoffs. This page demonstrates how to build a multi-agent system with multi-turn conversations, including human-in-the-loop interactions, agent handoffs, and state management using LangGraph, Command objects, and interrupts.
