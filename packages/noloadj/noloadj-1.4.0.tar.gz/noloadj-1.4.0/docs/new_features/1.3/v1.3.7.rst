What's new in version 1.3.7
===========================
Version available since March 8th 2024

New Features
------------
- Add one file 'ode_extracted_features' to group features that can be extracted from ODE simulation.
- Add one extracted frequency feature : 'THD' for Total Harmonic Distortion.
- New tests in Test_Jacobien_ODE_System file : check the gradients for odeint45_extract function with final time and threshold value as stopping criteria.

Changes
-------
- Delete two files 'ode45_fft' and 'ode45_extract_fft'.
- features from ode_extracted_features file are defined as classes instead of functions.
