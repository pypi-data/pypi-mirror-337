This module restricts the addresses to be used in the sales order form
to only addresses of the selected customer.

When managing dropship delivery addresses, a delivery address needs to
be created for the buyer main contact. You can then mark the checkbox
'Dropship Address' on the delivery address to prevent the buyer main
contact name to be displayed as part of the delivery address name.
