# Methods of a CocoIndex Flow

After a flow is defined as discussed in [Flow Definition](/docs/core/flow_def), you get a Flow object and can call its methods to operate with it.

## update

The `update()` method will update the index defined by the flow.

Once the function returns, the indice is fresh up to the moment when the function is called.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
flow.update()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## evaluate_and_dump

The `evaluate_and_dump()` method evaluates the flow and dump flow outputs to files.

It takes a `EvaluateAndDumpOptions` dataclass as input to configure, with the following fields:

*   `output_dir` (type: `str`, required): The directory to dump the result to.
*   `use_cache` (type: `bool`, default: `True`): Use already-cached intermediate data if available.
    Note that we only reuse existing cached data without updating the cache even if it's turned on.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
flow.evaluate_and_dump(EvaluateAndDumpOptions(output_dir="./eval_output"))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
