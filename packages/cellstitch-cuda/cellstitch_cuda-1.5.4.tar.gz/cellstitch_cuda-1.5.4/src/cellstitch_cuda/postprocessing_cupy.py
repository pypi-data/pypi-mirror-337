    Parameters:
    masks (ndarray): Int, 2D or 3D array of labelled masks.
        0 represents no mask, while positive integers represent mask labels.
        The size can be [Ly x Lx] or [Lz x Ly x Lx].
    min_size (int, optional): Minimum number of pixels per mask.
        Masks smaller than min_size will be removed.
        Set to -1 to turn off this functionality. Default is 15.
    n_jobs (int): Parallel processing cores to use. Default is -1.

    Returns:
    ndarray: Int, 2D or 3D array of masks with holes filled and small masks removed.
        0 represents no mask, while positive integers represent mask labels.
        The size is [Ly x Lx] or [Lz x Ly x Lx].
