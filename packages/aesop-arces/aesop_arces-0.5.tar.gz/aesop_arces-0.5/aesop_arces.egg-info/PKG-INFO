    :alt: Paper

The ARC Echelle Spectroscopic Observation Pipeline, or ``aesop``, is a high resolution
spectroscopy software toolkit tailored for observations from the `ARC Echelle Spectrograph (ARCES)
<https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/Instruments/ARCES/>`_ mounted on the
`ARC 3.5 m Telescope <https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/>`_ at
`Apache Point Observatory <https://www.apo.nmsu.edu>`_. ``aesop`` picks up where the
traditional IRAF reduction scripts leave off, offering an open development,
object-oriented Pythonic analysis framework for echelle spectra.

Basic functionality of ``aesop`` includes: (1) blaze function normalization by polynomial
fits to observations of early-type stars, (2) an additional/alternative robust least-squares
normalization method, (3) radial velocity measurements (or offset removals) via
cross-correlation with model spectra, including barycentric radial velocity calculations,
(4) concatenation of multiple echelle orders into a simple 1D spectrum, and (5) approximate
flux calibration.


Installation
------------

You can install ``aesop`` from the source code by doing the following::

    git clone https://github.com/bmorris3/aesop.git
    cd aesop
    pip install .

For more information, `read the docs <https://arces.readthedocs.io/>`_.
