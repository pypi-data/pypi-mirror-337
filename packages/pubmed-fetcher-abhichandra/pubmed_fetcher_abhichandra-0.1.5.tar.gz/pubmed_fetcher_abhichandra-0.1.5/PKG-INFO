## Usage
### Running the CLI

```

### Running Tests
Run unit tests using pytest:
```sh
poetry run pytest tests/
```

## How It Works
1. **CLI Execution:**
   - User provides a search term.
   - The CLI interacts with the PubMed API.
   - The results are fetched and displayed.

2. **PubMed API Interaction:**
   - Queries PubMed using `requests`.
   - Parses and formats the response.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - Results are printed in a readable format.
   - Can be exported as JSON.

---

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **CLI output is None:** Ensure you are running the command correctly with a valid query.
- **Encoding errors in Windows:** Run the following before executing the script:
  ```sh
  set PYTHONUTF8=1
  ```
