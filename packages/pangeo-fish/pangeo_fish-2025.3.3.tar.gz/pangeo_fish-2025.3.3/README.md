# Pangeo-Fish üêü

**Pangeo-Fish** is an open, community-driven project designed to leverage the power of the Pangeo ecosystem specifically for fish biologging data analysis and related oceanographic research. The project facilitates scalable, reproducible, and collaborative research by integrating biologging data with environmental datasets using cloud-native technologies.

## üåä Project Goals

- **Simplify Biologging Data Analysis:** Integrate and streamline analyses of diverse fish biologging datasets with oceanographic and environmental data.
- **Leverage Cloud Infrastructure:** Utilize Pangeo technologies such as Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter to perform large-scale, efficient computations.
- **Promote Collaboration:** Foster an inclusive community where researchers and developers can share expertise, resources, and innovative tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pangeo-fish
```

Or set up the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pangeo-fish/pangeo-fish.git
cd pangeo-fish
conda env create -n pangeo-fish -f environment.yml
conda activate pangeo-fish
jupyter lab
```
