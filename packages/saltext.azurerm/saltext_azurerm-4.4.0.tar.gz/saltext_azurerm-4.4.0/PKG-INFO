# Salt Extension Modules for Azure Resource Manager

Salt Extension for interacting with Microsoft Azure

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please refer
to [Salt's security guide][security].

## User Documentation

For setup and usage instructions, please refer to the
[User Documentation][docs].

## Contributing

The saltext-azurerm project welcomes contributions from anyone!

The [Salt Extensions guide][salt-extensions-guide] provides comprehensive instructions on all aspects
of Salt extension development, including [writing tests][writing-tests], [running tests][running-tests],
[writing documentation][writing-docs] and [rendering the docs][rendering-docs].

### Quickstart

To get started contributing, first clone this repository (or your fork):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone --origin upstream git@github.com:salt-extensions/saltext-azurerm.git

# Change to the repo dir
cd saltext-azurerm
```

#### Automatic
If you have installed [direnv][direnv], copying the included `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` and
allowing it to run ensures a proper development environment is present and the virtual environment is active.

Without `direnv`, you can still run the automation explicitly:

```bash
make dev  # or python3 tools/initialize.py
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Manual
Please follow the [first steps][first-steps], skipping the repository initialization and first commit.

### Pull request

Always make changes in a feature branch:

```bash
git switch -c my-feature-branch
```

Please ensure you include a [news fragment](https://salt-extensions.github.io/salt-extension-copier/topics/documenting/changelog.html#procedure)
describing your changes. This is a requirement for all user-facing changes (bug fixes, new features),
with the exception of documentation changes.

To [submit a Pull Request][submitting-pr], you'll need a fork of this repository in
your own GitHub account. If you followed the instructions above,
set your fork as the `origin` remote now:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_fork>.git
```

Ensure you followed the [first steps][first-steps] and commit your changes, fixing any
failing `pre-commit` hooks. Then push the feature branch to your fork and submit a PR.

### Ways to contribute

Contributions come in many forms, and theyâ€™re all valuable! Here are some ways you can help
without writing code:

* **Documentation**: Especially examples showing how to use this project
  to solve specific problems.
* **Triaging issues**: Help manage [issues][issues] and participate in [discussions][discussions].
* **Reviewing [Pull Requests][PRs]**: We especially appreciate reviews using [Conventional Comments][comments].

You can also contribute by:

* Writing blog posts
* Sharing your experiences using Salt + Azure Resource Manager
  on social media
* Giving talks at conferences
* Publishing videos
* Engaging in IRC, Discord or email groups

Any of these things are super valuable to our community, and we sincerely
appreciate every contribution!
