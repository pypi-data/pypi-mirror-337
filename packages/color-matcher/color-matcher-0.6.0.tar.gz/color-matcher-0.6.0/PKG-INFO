color-matcher enables color transfer across images which comes in handy for automatic color-grading
of photographs, paintings and film sequences as well as light-field and stopmotion corrections. The methods behind
the mappings are based on the approach from Reinhard et al., the Monge-Kantorovich Linearization (MKL) as proposed by
Pitie et al. and our analytical solution to a Multi-Variate Gaussian Distribution (MVGD) transfer in conjunction with
classical histogram matching. As shown below our HM-MVGD-HM compound outperforms existing methods.
