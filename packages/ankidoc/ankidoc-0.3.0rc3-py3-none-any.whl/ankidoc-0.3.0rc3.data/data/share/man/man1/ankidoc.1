.SH DESCRIPTION
.
\fBankidoc\fP is a short python script intended to make writing anki notes in
asciidoc easier. It can be used to generate a text file for import into anki
from notes written in asciidoc.
.
.P
The asciidoc notes need to be in a specific format in order for the script to
be able to work with them; Every note needs to be a directory with its name
ending in \fI.anote\fP. The name of this directory (excluding the extension),
will become the ID of the note in the final import file.
.
.P
For everything to work correctly, this directory must contain three files:
.
.TP
.I front.adoc
An asciidoc file containing everything that should be on the front side of the
note.
.
.TP
.I back.adoc
An asciidoc file containing everything that should be on the back side of the
note.
.
.TP
.I tags.txt
A text file containing space-separated tags for the note. This file is
optional, but its absence will throw a warning.
.
.P
In its default operating mode, \fBankidoc\fP will take a list of such anote
directories as input and generate a single anki import file out of them.
.
.SS MODES
.
Besides the default mode described above, \fBankidoc\fP supports additional
modes that work slightly differently.
.
.TP
.B Notegen mode
In notegen mode \(em selected by specifying the \fB-n\fP option \(em
\fBankidoc\fP will only take in one single anote directory and output a
\(dqnote\(dq file, which essentially corresponds to a single note how it would
appear in the final import file generated in default mode. These note files can
then be linked into an anki import file using the link mode.
.
.TP
.B Link mode
In link mode \(em selected by specifying the \fB-l\fP option \(em \fBankidoc\fP
will treat the input files as \(dqnote\(dq files and link them into an anki
import file.
.
.TP
.B Docgen mode
Similarly to the notegen mode, when running in docgen mode, \fBankidoc\fP will
only take in a single anote directory, but instead of producing HTML formatted
as a note file, it produces an asciidoc document.
.
.TP
.B Preview mode
Similarly to the docgen mode, when running in preview mode, \fBankidoc\fP will
only take in a single anote directory, but instead of producing an asciidoc
document, it will produce a HTML file that can be opened using a browser to
preview the note.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-attributes " ATTR
Specify any asciidoc(tor) attributes. Whatever string is specified here will be
passed on as\-is to the \fB-a\fP argument of the 
.BR asciidoctor (1)
command.
.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-docgen
Run \fBankidoc\fP in docgen mode.
.
.TP
.BI "\-D, \-\-deck " DECK
Specify a deck name, which will be set as default deck in the import file.
.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-front\-matter
When running in docgen mode, add front matter in TOML to the output, for use in
static site generators like HUGO or 11ty.
.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-link
Run \fBankidoc\fP in link mode.
.
.TP
.BI "\-L, \-\-loglevel " LV
Select a logging level from \(dqDEBUG\(dq, \(dqINFO\(dq, \(dqWARNING\(dq,
\(dqERROR\(dq, \(dqCRITICAL\(dq.
.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-notegen
Run \fBankidoc\fP in notegen mode.
.
.TP
.BI "\-N, \-\-notetype " TYPE
Specify a note type, which will be set as default note type in the import file.
.
.TP
.BI "\-o, \-\-output " OUT
Specify the desired output filename.
.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Display version information.
.
.TP
.I files
Specify the files to operate on. Note that these generally have to be one ore
multiple \fI.anote\fP directories in oder for \fBankidoc\fP to work. When
operating in link mode, however, these files have to be \fI.note\fP files.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.
.TP
.B 0
Success.
.
.TP
.B 1
Failure.
.
.SH NOTES
For \fBankidoc\fP to work you'll have to have
.BR asciidoctor (1)
installed, as this is the program \fBankidoc\fP uses to convert the asciidoc to
HTML.
