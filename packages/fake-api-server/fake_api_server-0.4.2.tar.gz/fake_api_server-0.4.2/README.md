## Overview

Do you ever have experience about needing to set up a very simple application and write some APIs with hardcode response again and again
for developing Font-End site? **_PyFake-API-Server_** provides a command line tool to let developers could quickly and easily set up application
to mock APIs with configuration only.


## Python versions support

The code base of **_PyFake-API-Server_** to set up an application still depends on third party Python package, i.e., **_Flask_**, **_FastAPI_**,
etc. So the Python versions it supports also be affected by them, e.g., **_Flask_** only supports Python version 3.9 up currently. So
**_PyFake-API-Server_** also only supports version Python 3.9 up.

## Quickly Start

Here section would lead you quickly start to set up your first one application by **_PyFake-API-Server_** for mocking API server easily.

In basically, it has 3 steps: install the package, configure settings about the APIs for mocking and run command.

* [Install](#install-command-line-tool)
* [Configure](#configure-setting-to-mock-target-apis)
* [Run](#run-command-to-set-up-application)

### Install command line tool

First of all, we need to install the command line tool and the way to install is same as installing Python package by ``pip``.

```console
>>> pip install fake-api-server
```

If the runtime environment has installed some Python web framework, e.g., **_Flask_**, you also could install **_PyFake-API-Server_**
with one specific option as following:

```console
>>> pip install "fake-api-server[flask]"
```

Then it would only install the lowest Python dependencies you need.

After you done above step, please make sure the command line tool feature should work finely by below command:

```console
>>> fake --help
```

> **Note**
>
> Please take a look at option _--app-type_ (this option is in subcommand **_mock run_**) of the command line tool. Its option
> value could be ``auto``, ``flask`` or ``fastapi``. It means that **_PyFake-API-Server_** only supports 2 Python web frameworks: **_Flask_**
> and **_FastAPI_**.

### Configure setting to mock target APIs

Now, we have the command line tool. Let's configure the settings it needs to set up application to mock API.

The configuration format of **_PyFake-API-Server_** to use is **YAML**. So let's write below settings in YAML file:

```yaml
mocked_apis:
  foo:
    url: '/foo'
    http:
      request:
        method: 'GET'
      response:
        strategy: string
        value: 'This is Foo API.'
```

### Run command to set up application

Now, both of the command line tool and configuration have been already. So let's try to run the command to set up application!

```console
>>> fake rest-server run -c <your configuration path>
```

You would see some log messages in terminal and that is the log of web server by one specific Python web framework.

And you could test the API by ``curl``:

```console
>>> curl http://127.0.0.1:9672/foo
"This is Foo home API."%
```
