deprecations:
  - |
    The ``circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.wire_cutting`` namespace
    is now deprecated. It has been renamed to
    ``circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutqc``.
    Both gate and wire cutting for simulating expectation values will be
    implemented directly into the ``circuit_cutting`` package, and the
    ``circuit_cutting.cutqc`` package will remain available for users of
    the automatic cut finding and/or the full probability distribution
    reconstruction.
