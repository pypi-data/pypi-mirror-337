# Benson

Benson is the powerhouse behind `Phil`, the advanced imputation engine designed to intelligently handle missing data in complex datasets. Whether you're dealing with high-dimensional gaps, inconsistent encodings, or stubborn anomalies, Benson ensures your data gets the cleanup it deserves—efficiently and at scale.

🔥 Capabilities

• Phil 🧩: **PHIL: a Progressive High-Dimensional Imputation Lab.**  
 Phil is an advanced data imputation tool that combines scikit-learn's IterativeImputer with topological methods to generate and analyze multiple versions of a dataset. It allows users to impute missing data using various techniques, generate representations of imputed datasets, and democratically select a representative version.

🚀 Coming Soon
• AgentBenson 🤖: A seamless integration layer for popular agentic frameworks, enabling automated data cleaning and repair with minimal intervention.  
• Bob 🛠️: A structured data repair module that cleans, normalizes, and reconciles inconsistencies in your datasets.

Stay tuned for more updates as Benson continues to evolve!
