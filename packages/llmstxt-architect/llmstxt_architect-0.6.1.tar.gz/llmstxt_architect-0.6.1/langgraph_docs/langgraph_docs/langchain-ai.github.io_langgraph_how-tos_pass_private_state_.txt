[How to pass private state between nodes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/pass_private_state/): LLM should read this page when implementing data sharing between specific nodes in LangGraph, handling private state in graph workflows, or designing multi-node sequential processes with selective data visibility. This page demonstrates how to pass private data between specific nodes in a LangGraph without making it part of the main schema, using typed dictionaries to define both public and private states, and showing a three-node example where private data flows only between the first two nodes.
