Introduction
------------

Bapt is a tool for generating publication-ready band alignment plots.


Usage
-----

Bapt can be used via the command-line or python api. For the full
documentation of the command-line flags, please use the built-in help:

    bapt -h

The bapt command-line can be controlled through command-line flags or
a settings file. The settings file provides considerably more flexibility
for things like custom gradients and fading effects.

A basic usage of the command-line interface:

    bapt --name "ZnO,MOF-5,HKUST-1,ZIF-8" --ip 7.7,7.3,6.0,6.4 --ea 4.4,2.7,5.1,1.9

produces a plot that is ready to go into any publication:

A more advanced plot, generated using the `examples/gradients.yaml` config
file, allows for additional effects:

    bapt --filename examples/gradients.yaml

In the alternative case of the relative alignment of bands, without vacuum alignment,
one can specify the band gap values `--band-gap` alongside the valence band offsets `--vbo`,
or equivalently the conduction band offsets `--cbo`:

    bapt -n ZnO,MOF-5,COF-1M --band-gap 1.774,1.366,1.6 --cbo 0.247,-0.4

The band offset approach can also be controlled through a yaml config file. For an example,
see `examples/offset.yml`.


Requirements
------------

Bapt is currently compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. Matplotlib is required
for plotting and PyYAML is needed for config files.

Bapt uses Pip and setuptools for installation. You *probably* already
have this; if not, your GNU/Linux package manager will be able to oblige
with a package named something like ``python-setuptools``. On Max OSX
the Python distributed with [Homebrew](<http://brew.sh>) includes
setuptools and Pip.


Installation
------------

Bapt is available on PyPI making installation easy:

    pip install --user bapt

Or:

    pip3 install --user bapt

To install the python 3 version.
