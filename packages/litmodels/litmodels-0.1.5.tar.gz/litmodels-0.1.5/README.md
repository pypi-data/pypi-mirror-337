______________________________________________________________________

**Lightning Models** is a streamlined toolkit for effortlessly saving, loading, and managing your model checkpoints.
Designed to simplify the entire model lifecycleâ€”from training and inference to sharing, deployment, and cloud integrationâ€”Lightning Models supports any framework that produces model checkpoints, including but not limited to PyTorch Lightning.

<pre>
âœ… Seamless Model Saving & Loading
âœ… Robust Checkpoint Management
âœ… Cloud Integration Out of the Box
âœ… Versatile Across Frameworks
</pre>

# Quick start

Install Lightning Models via pip (more installation options below):

```bash
pip install -U litmodels
```

Or install directly from source:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Lightning-AI/models/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

## Saving and Loading Models

Lightning Models offers a simple API to manage your model checkpoints.
Train your model using your preferred framework (our fist examples show `scikit-learn`) and then save your best checkpoint with a single function call.

### Train scikit-learn model and save it

```python
from sklearn import datasets, model_selection, svm
from litmodels import upload_model

# Unique model identifier: <organization>/<teamspace>/<model-name>
MY_MODEL_NAME = "your_org/your_team/sklearn-svm-model"

# Load example dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train a simple SVC model
model = svm.SVC()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Upload the saved model using litmodels
upload_model(model=model, name=MY_MODEL_NAME)
```

### Download and Load the Model for inference

```python
from litmodels import load_model

# Unique model identifier: <organization>/<teamspace>/<model-name>
MY_MODEL_NAME = "your_org/your_team/sklearn-svm-model"

# Download and load the model file from cloud storage
model = load_model(name=MY_MODEL_NAME, download_dir="my_models")

# Example: run inference with the loaded model
sample_input = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]
prediction = model.predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

## Saving and Loading Models with Pytorch Lightning

Next examples demonstrate seamless PyTorch Lightning integration with Lightning Models.

### Train a simple Lightning model and save it

```python
from lightning import Trainer
from litmodels import upload_model
from litmodels.demos import BoringModel

# Define the model name - this should be unique to your model
MY_MODEL_NAME = "<organization>/<teamspace>/<model-name>"

# Configure Lightning Trainer
trainer = Trainer(max_epochs=2)
# Define the model and train it
trainer.fit(BoringModel())

# Upload the best model to cloud storage
checkpoint_path = getattr(trainer.checkpoint_callback, "best_model_path")
upload_model(model=checkpoint_path, name=MY_MODEL_NAME)
```

### Download and Load the Model for fine-tuning

```python
from lightning import Trainer
from litmodels import download_model
from litmodels.demos import BoringModel

# Define the model name - this should be unique to your model
MY_MODEL_NAME = "<organization>/<teamspace>/<model-name>:<model-version>"

# Load the model from cloud storage
checkpoint_path = download_model(name=MY_MODEL_NAME, download_dir="my_models")
print(f"model: {checkpoint_path}")

# Train the model with extended training period
trainer = Trainer(max_epochs=4)
trainer.fit(BoringModel(), ckpt_path=checkpoint_path)
```

    <summary>Checkpointing Workflow with Lightning</summary>

Enhance your training process with an automatic checkpointing callback that uploads the model at the end of each epoch.

```python
import torch.utils.data as data
import torchvision as tv
from lightning import Trainer
from litmodels.integrations import LightningModelCheckpoint
from litmodels.demos import BoringModel

# Define the model name - this should be unique to your model
MY_MODEL_NAME = "<organization>/<teamspace>/<model-name>"

dataset = tv.datasets.MNIST(".", download=True, transform=tv.transforms.ToTensor())
train, val = data.random_split(dataset, [55000, 5000])

trainer = Trainer(
    max_epochs=2,
    callbacks=[LightningModelCheckpoint(model_name=MY_MODEL_NAME)],
)
trainer.fit(
    BoringModel(),
    data.DataLoader(train, batch_size=256),
    data.DataLoader(val, batch_size=256),
)
```
