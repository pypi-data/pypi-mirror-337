# Malloy Publisher Client

A Python client for interacting with the Malloy Publisher API. This client provides a type-safe interface for working with Malloy projects, packages, models, and executing queries.

## Features

- Type-safe API client with Pydantic models
- Full support for Malloy Publisher API endpoints
- Async HTTP client using `httpx`
- Comprehensive error handling
- Context manager support for resource cleanup

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- UV package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malloy-publisher-client.git
cd malloy-publisher-client
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies using UV:
```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the client:

```python
from molloy_publisher_client import MalloyAPIClient, QueryParams

# Initialize the client
client = MalloyAPIClient(
    base_url="https://your-malloy-publisher-url",
    api_key="your-api-key"  # Optional
)

# List all projects
projects = client.list_projects()

# List packages in a project
packages = client.list_packages("project_name")

# List models in a package
models = client.list_models("project_name", "package_name")

# Execute a query
query_params = QueryParams(
    project_name="project_name",
    package_name="package_name",
    path="model_path",
    query="your query here"
)
result = client.execute_query(query_params)

# Use as a context manager
with MalloyAPIClient(base_url="https://your-malloy-publisher-url") as client:
    # Your code here
    pass
```
