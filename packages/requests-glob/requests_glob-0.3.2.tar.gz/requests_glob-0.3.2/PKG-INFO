Requests-Glob
=============

Requests-Glob is a transport adapter for use with the `Requests`_ Python
library to allow local filesystem access via glob:\/\/ URLs.

To use:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from requests_glob import GlobAdapter

    s = requests.Session()
    s.mount('glob://', GlobAdapter())

    resp = s.get('glob:///glob_expression')

Features
--------

- Will open and read local files
- Might set a Content-Length header
- That's about it

Also, url can contain query information, such as glob (yes - default, no),
glob_include_hidden (no - default, yes), glob_recursive (yes - default, no)

No encoding information is set in the response object, so be careful using
Response.text: the chardet library will be used to convert the file to a
unicode type and it may not detect what you actually want.

EACCES is converted to a 403 status code, and ENOENT is converted to a
404. All other IOError types are converted to a 400.
