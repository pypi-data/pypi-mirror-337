# Lossy Image

This project provides a framework for performing lossy image compression using various algorithms and evaluating the compression quality with multiple metrics. It includes implementations for managing compression processes, evaluating results, and handling different compression algorithms.

## Features
- Modular Compression Framework: Easily plug in different compression algorithms.
- Evaluation Metrics: Supports multiple image quality metrics to compare original and compressed images.
- Results Handling: Stores and processes compression and evaluation results.
- Flexible Input Options: Evaluate using image file paths or compression results.
