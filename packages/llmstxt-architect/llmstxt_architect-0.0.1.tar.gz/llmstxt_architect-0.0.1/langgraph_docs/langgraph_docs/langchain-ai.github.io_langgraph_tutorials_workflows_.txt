[Workflows and Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/): LLM should read this page when implementing agent systems, designing workflow architectures, or troubleshooting LLM orchestration strategies. The page covers patterns for LLM system design, comparing workflows (predefined paths) vs agents (dynamic control), with implementations of prompt chaining, parallelization, routing, orchestrator-worker, evaluator-optimizer, and agent patterns using both graph and functional APIs in LangGraph.
