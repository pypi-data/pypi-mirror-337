class CharacterTextSplitter:
    """
    A class for splitting text into chunks based on a specified separator.

    This class implements an algorithm to split text into chunks of a specified size,
    with an optional overlap between chunks. It uses a single separator to determine
    where to split the text.

    Attributes:
        separator (str): The string used to split the text.
        chunk_size (int): The maximum size of each chunk.
        chunk_overlap (int): The number of characters to overlap between chunks.
        length_function (callable): A function used to calculate the length of text.
