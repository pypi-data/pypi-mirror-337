# ScriKit (The Script Kit)

![scrikit Logo](images/scrikit-logo.png)

ScriKit is a lightweight no-dependency toolkit for quickly building consistently beautiful CLI python scripts. Really, it's just a collection of my most-used utilities and variables. 

## Features

- Script Class: Quickly build scripts with colorful banners, built-in benchmarking, and more.
- Color Theme: Predefined color variables, organized into a theme.
- Enhanced Logging: Automatically overrides the native logging formatter with colorized output for different log levels.
- Data displays: Also contains a table and tree display functions for visualizing data in the terminal.

## Installation

You can download the source code and copy into your project, or install directly into your python environment with: 

```pip install scrikit```
