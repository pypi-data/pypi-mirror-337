[Few-shot prompting](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/): LLM should read this page when wanting to learn about few-shot prompting techniques, improving model performance with examples, or implementing effective example selection strategies. (This page explains few-shot prompting in 4 key areas: generating good examples (manual, better model, feedback), determining optimal example quantity, selecting examples (random, similarity-based), and formatting examples properly in prompts. It covers both single-turn and multi-turn examples, considerations for tool-calling, and best practices for different models.)
