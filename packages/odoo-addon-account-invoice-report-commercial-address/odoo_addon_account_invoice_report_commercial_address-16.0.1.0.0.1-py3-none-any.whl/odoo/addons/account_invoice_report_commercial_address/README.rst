Installation
============

Simply install the module.

Configuration
=============

Default Settings

- The 'Show Commercial Entity' option is enabled in the account.move
  model when the partner differs from its commercial entity"
- The commercial address displayed corresponds to the parent address of
  the company.

Usage
=====

Locate the Setting

- Open an invoice and go to the "Other Information" tab.

Toggle the Checkbox

- You will see a checkbox labeled "Show Commercial Entity." This field
  is not active by default. It will be automatically activated or
  deactivated depending on whether the partner differs from its
  commercial entity.
- When active, the invoice will display the commercial address (the
  parent company’s address) near the invoice subtotal, in addition to
  the usual billing contact address.
- For a particular invoice, if you do not want to display the commercial
  address—even when a different billing address is set—you can manually
  change this option.
