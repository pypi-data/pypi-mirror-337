*Python download library*

## 1. Installation

```bash
pip install download_boss
```

&nbsp;

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 HttpClient
Simple request
```python
from requests import Request
from download_boss.client.request.RequestEnvelope import RequestEnvelope
from download_boss.client.HttpClient import HttpClient

request = RequestEnvelope(
    Request(method='POST', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/hello', json={"hello": "world"},
    {'verify': False, 'timeout': 10})
)
response = HttpClient().download(request)
print(response.text)

```

Retry based on HTTP status codes
```python
from requests import Request
from download_boss.client.request.RequestEnvelope import RequestEnvelope
from download_boss.client.HttpClient import HttpClient
from download_boss.error.ClientRetriable import ClientRetriable

request = RequestEnvelope(
    Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/hello')
)
client = HttpClient(throwRetriableStatusCodeRanges=[401, range(500,599)])

while True:
    try:
        response = client.download(request)
        print(response.text)
        break
    except ClientRetriable:
        continue

```

Kerberos authentication:
```python
from requests import Request
from requests_kerberos import HTTPKerberosAuth, OPTIONAL
from download_boss.client.request.RequestEnvelope import RequestEnvelope
from download_boss.client.HttpClient import HttpClient

request = RequestEnvelope(
    Request(method='POST', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/kerb', auth=HTTPKerberosAuth(mutual_authentication=OPTIONAL))
)
response = HttpClient().download(request)
```

### 2.2. RetryWrapper

Retry automatically some HTTP status codes
```python
from requests import Request
from download_boss.client.request.RequestEnvelope import RequestEnvelope
from download_boss.client.HttpClient import HttpClient
from download_boss.wrapper.RetryWrapper import RetryWrapper
from download_boss.error.RetriesExhausted import RetriesExhausted

request = RequestEnvelope(
    Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/status/500')
)
client = HttpClient(throwRetriableStatusCodeRanges=[401, range(500,599)])
client = RetryWrapper(client, count=1, catchRetriableStatusCodeRanges=[range(500,599)])

try:
    response = client.download(request)
except RetriesExhausted:
    print("Retries exhausted!")

"""
```

### 2.3. DelayWrapper

Delay download calls by 2-5 seconds

```python
from requests import Request
from download_boss.client.request.RequestEnvelope import RequestEnvelope
from download_boss.client.HttpClient import HttpClient
from download_boss.wrapper.RetryWrapper import RetryWrapper
from download_boss.wrapper.DelayWrapper import DelayWrapper
from download_boss.error.RetriesExhausted import RetriesExhausted

client = HttpClient(throwRetriableStatusCodeRanges=[401, range(500,599)])
client = RetryWrapper(client, count=1, catchRetriableStatusCodeRanges=[range(500,599)]) 
client = DelayWrapper(client, length=2, maxLength=5) 

requests = [
    RequestEnvelope( Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/one') ),
    RequestEnvelope( Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/two') ),
    RequestEnvelope( Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/three') )
]

for r in requests:
    response = client.download(r)

"""

```

### 2.4. FileCacheWrapper
```python
from os.path import join, dirname
from requests import Request
from download_boss.client.request.RequestEnvelope import RequestEnvelope
from download_boss.client.HttpClient import HttpClient
from download_boss.wrapper.RetryWrapper import RetryWrapper
from download_boss.wrapper.DelayWrapper import DelayWrapper

client = FileCacheWrapper(client, cacheFolderPath, cacheLength)

requests = [
    RequestEnvelope( Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/one') ),
    RequestEnvelope( Request(method='GET', url='https://httpbin.org/anything/one') ),
