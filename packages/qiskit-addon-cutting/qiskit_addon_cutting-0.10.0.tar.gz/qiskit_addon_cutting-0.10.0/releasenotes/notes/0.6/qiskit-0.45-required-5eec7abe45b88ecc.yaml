    The minimum supported version of ``qiskit`` is now 0.45.0, and the
    minimum supported version of ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` is now 0.12.2.
    CKT also now explicitly requires a version of ``qiskit`` less than
    1.0, as there is no guarantee that the current version of CKT will
    work with Qiskit 1.0.
