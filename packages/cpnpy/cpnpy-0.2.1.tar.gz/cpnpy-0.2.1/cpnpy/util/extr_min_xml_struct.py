"""
This script parses an XML file and produces a very compact JSON structure
of the form:

{
  "tag1": {
    "attributes": ["attrA", "attrB", "attrC"],
    "children": ["childTag1", "childTag2"]
  },
  "tag2": {
    "attributes": [],
    "children": ["anotherTag", "somethingElse"]
  },
  ...
}

**Data Semantics**:
- The top-level keys are unique tag names in the document (e.g., "book", "chapter", "page").
- "attributes": The union of all attribute names found on that tag anywhere in the XML.
- "children": The union of all tag names that appear as direct children of that tag anywhere in the XML.
  For example, if in one part of the document <tagA> has child <foo>, and in another <tagA> has child <bar>,
  then the script records "children": ["bar", "foo"] (or some sorted order).

**What is NOT included**:
- Exact parent/child relationships beyond the knowledge that a tag can contain certain child tags.
  (We do NOT store the fact that tagA might appear multiple times in different places. We merge them.)
- Repetitions, nesting levels, text content, or any other node data beyond attributes and child tag names.
- Ordering of children.
