Yes, good catch! ✅ You **need to have a `README.md` file** in your project root **before building** the package. It's used as the **long description** for your PyPI page (what people see when they visit your package).

### ✍️ How to Create `README.md`

In your project root (`E:\tamilocrx`), create a new file named `README.md` and add something like:

```markdown
# tamilocrx

`tamilocrx` is a Python package that extracts Tamil text from images using deep learning-based OCR models like **CRAFT** for text detection and **PARSeq** for recognition.

## 🚀 Features

- Detect and extract Tamil and English text
- Based on PyTorch, CRAFT, and PARSeq
- Easy to use with Gradio demo

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install tamilocrx
```

## 🧪 Usage

```python
from tamilocrx.ocr import OCR

ocr = OCR(detect=True, enable_cuda=False)
result = ocr.predict("path/to/image.jpg")
print(result)
```

## 📦 Model Files

- `parseq_tamil.pt` – Tamil text recognition model
- `craft_mlt_25k.pth` – Text detection model
