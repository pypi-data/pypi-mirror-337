Enable training on non-Gaussian observation noise with warping.

Warp functions are used to map data to a different domain to train the Gaussian
process. Although Vanguard contains many pre-written warp functions, any new
ones can be created by subclassing :class:`~basefunction.WarpFunction` and
implementing the :meth:`~basefunction.WarpFunction.forward`,
:meth:`~basefunction.WarpFunction.inverse` and (optionally)
:meth:`~basefunction.WarpFunction.deriv` methods.

Warp functions are applied to a :class:`~vanguard.base.gpcontroller.GPController`
subclass using the :class:`SetWarp` decorator.
