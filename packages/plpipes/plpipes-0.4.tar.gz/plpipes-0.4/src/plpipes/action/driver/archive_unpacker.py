"""This module contains the _ArchiveUnpacker class, which is responsible for handling actions with type `archive_unpacker`
 within the plpipes framework.

The `archive_unpacker` action reads the configuration to identify the
archive file and its target extraction location.  It utilizes the
patoolib library to perform the extraction of the specified archive.
