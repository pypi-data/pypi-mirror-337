## Version Scheme

FlatForge follows semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for added functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes

Example: 1.2.3
- 1 = Major version
- 2 = Minor version
- 3 = Patch version

## Release Naming Convention

- Release tags: `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}` (e.g., `v0.3.0`)
- Test script naming: `test_feature_v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}_{YYYYMMDD}.py`
