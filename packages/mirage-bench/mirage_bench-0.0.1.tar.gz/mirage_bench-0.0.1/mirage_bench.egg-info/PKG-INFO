           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# MIRAGE-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Generation Across Multiple Languages

This repository provides an easy way to achieve the following four objectives:

1. Generate RAG-based answers to multilingual questions, with support for many open-source LLMs integrated via [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html), as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs such as Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, etc.
2. Evaluate multilingual RAG answers based on a variety of heuristic features (e.g., support, fluency) or automatic evaluations using open-source LLMs supported in vLLM.
3. Conduct an LLM-as-a-Judge design to compare pairwise multilingual RAG answers and train a Bradley-Terry model (with bootstrapping) to build an offline multilingual RAG arena.
4. Train a surrogate judge (linear regression) to learn from and bootstrap the expensive LLM-as-a-Judge approach using heuristic features.

For more information, check out our publication:
- [MIRAGE-Bench: Automatic Multilingual Benchmark Arena for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13716) (Accepted at NAACL 2025 Main Conference :star:)

## Installation

We recommend **Python 3.9+** and installing the latest version of **[vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html)**.

**Install with pip:**

```bash
pip install -U mirage-bench
```

**Install from sources**

Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from the [repository](https://github.com/vectara/mirage-bench) and install it directly from the source code:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Datasets

| Resource | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| :hugs: [mirage-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nthakur/mirage-bench) | All queries & input prompts available in MIRAGE-Bench |
| :hugs: [mirage-bench-output](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nthakur/mirage-bench-output) | Pre-computed RAG answers and all feature scores for 21 models |
| :hugs: [mirage-bench-pairwise-judgments](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nthakur/mirage-bench-pairwise-judgments) | Pairwise judgments using GPT-4o LLM judge across all 19 models |

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest **[vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html)** installed correctly.

### 1. Multilingual RAG Answer Generation

Generate the RAG answer for given multilingual queries in mirage-bench using an LLM model.
> Similarly, you can even generate answers with HF models on single/multiple GPU instances with [vLLM](https://github.com/vectara/mirage-bench/blob/main/examples/generation/vllm_generation.py).

```python
# export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="xxxxx"
# export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxx"

from mirage_bench import util
from mirage_bench.generate import AzureOpenAIClient

# Many other clients also available, e.g., Cohere or Anthropic
client = AzureOpenAIClient(model_name_or_path="gpt-4o-mini")

### Prompts_dict contains query_id as key and prompt as value
prompts_dict = util.load_prompts(
    dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench", 
    language_code="en", # or "ar", "bn" ... 18 languages supported
    split="dev" # only dev split is available in mirage-bench
) 
query_ids = list(prompts_dict.keys())
outputs = client.batch_call(
    prompts=list(prompts_dict.values()),
    temperature=0.1,
    max_new_tokens=2048,
)
#### output contains the List of RAG outputs
```

### 2. Heuristic \& Automatic RAG Evaluation

After generating RAG answers, we evaluate the quality of the response using heuristic features:

```python
from mirage_bench import util
from mirage_bench.evaluate import RougeBleuEvaluator

evaluator = RougeBleuEvaluator(language_code="en")

# Load the documents (relevant & non-relevant)
documents = util.load_documents(
    dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench", 
    language_code="en", 
    split="dev"
)

# Load the multilingual RAG predictions available for 20+ models.
# In this example, we are evaluating: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
predictions = util.load_predictions(
    dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench-output",
    language_code="en",
    split="dev",
    model_name="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
)

# Need to load the reference model, i.e., ground_truth predictions
# This step is not necessary in all heuristic features
reference_predictions = util.load_predictions(
    dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench-output",
    language_code="en",
    split="dev",
    model_name="gpt-4-azure",
)

# Evaluate the predictions
scores = evaluator.evaluate(
    predictions=predictions, 
    reference_predictions=reference_predictions, 
    documents=documents
)
# => query_id: {"answer_bleu": 0.9, "answer_rougeL": 0.75}
```

### 3. LLM-as-a-Judge Pairwise Evaluation

After generating RAG answers, we can also use a LLM as a judge to compare two RAG outputs and decide which output is better.

```python
from mirage_bench import util
from mirage_bench.evaluate import PairwiseLLMJudgeEvaluator

evaluator = PairwiseLLMJudgeEvaluator(
    client="azure_openai",
    model_name_or_path="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Load the documents (relevant & non-relevant)
documents = util.load_documents(
    dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench", 
    language_code="en", 
    split="dev"
)
queries = util.load_queries(
    dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench", 
    language_code="en", 
    split="dev"
)

# In this example we will evaluate two models:
models = [
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"
]

for model_name in models:
    predictions[model_name] = util.load_predictions(
        dataset_name="nthakur/mirage-bench-output",
        language_code="en",
        split="dev",
        model_name=model_name,
    )

scores = evaluator.evaluate(
    predictions=predictions,
    all_model_names=models, # provide all model names
    documents=documents,
    queries=queries
)
# IMP: model_A and model_B are randomly switched
# => [{"query_id": 1, 
#      "judge": "gpt-4o-mini", 
#      "model_A": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", 
#      "model_B": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", 
#      "output": <judge_output>,
#      "verdict": A/B/Tie.
#    }]
```
