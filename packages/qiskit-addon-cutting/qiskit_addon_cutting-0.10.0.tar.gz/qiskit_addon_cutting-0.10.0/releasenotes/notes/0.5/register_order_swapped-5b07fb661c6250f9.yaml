    The order of the classical registers in the generated experiments
    has been swapped.  The ``"observable_measurements"`` register now
    comes first, and the ``"qpd_measurements"`` register now comes
    second.  As a result of this change, it is no longer necessary to
    manually insert ``num_qpd_bits`` into the ``metadata`` for each
    experiment's result.
