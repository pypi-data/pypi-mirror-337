# VERTEX: Accelerated fMRI Functional Connectivity Tools
VERTEX is a a python for functional connectivity analysis at the voxel / vertex level that utilizes pytorch for GPU speed ups and scipy sparse matrices for memory savings.

# Tools:
	[] list tools: vFC tools
	[] clustering methods:
		[] PM: infomaps - for individual parcellations
		[] PM: with other clustering techniques
		[] PM: integrate with Sparse-Low Rank Clustering


# Acceleration Effects:
Comparisons are with `wb_command` package (~~version~~):
