# SRS and CA Checklist

**Created by**: Spencer Smith

---
### Follows [writing checklist](https://github.com/ssm-lab/capstone--source-code-optimizer/blob/main/docs/Checklists/Writing-Checklist.pdf)
  - [ ] LaTeX points
  - [ ] Structure
  - [ ] Spelling, grammar, attention to detail
  - [ ] Avoid low information content phrases
  - [ ] Writing style
### Follows the template, all parts present
  - [ ] File name for the SRS matches the name in the template repo
  - [ ] Table of contents
  - [ ] Pages are numbered
  - [ ] Revision history included for major revisions
  - [ ] Sections from template are all present
  - [ ] Values of auxiliary constants are given (constants are used to improve
    maintainability and to increase understandability)
  - [ ] Symbolic names are used for quantities, rather than literal values
### Overall qualities of documentation
  - [ ] No statement is repeated at the same level of abstraction (for instance
    the scope should be more abstract than the assumptions, the goal statements
    should be more abstract than the requirements, etc.)
  - [ ] Someone that meets the characteristics of the intended reader could
    learn what they need to know
  - [ ] Someone that meets the characteristics of the intended reader could
    verify all of the statement made in the SRS.  That is, they do not have to
    trust the SRS authors on any information.
  - [ ] Terminology, definitions, symbols, TMs and DDs can be given without
      derivation, except possibly for a source (citation), but all GDs and IMs
      should be derived/justified.  At least check a representative sample for
      this criteria.
  - [ ] SRS is unambiguous.  At least check a representative sample.
  - [ ] SRS is consistent.  At least check a representative sample.
  - [ ] SRS is validatable.  At least check a representative sample.
  - [ ] SRS is abstract.  At least check a representative sample.
  - [ ] SRS is traceable.  At least check a representative sample.
  - [ ] Literal symbols (like numbers) do not appear, instead being
      represented by SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS (constants are given in a table in the
      Appendix)

### Reference Material
  - [ ] All units introduced are listed (searching the document can help look
    for other units that may be present, but not listed)
  - [ ] Units listed are each used at least once (manually searching the
    document is a quick way to check this)
  - [ ] All non-SI units should be checked to see if they are really what is
  intended.  This also applies for unit modifiers, like m, k, c, etc.  That is,
  should mm really be m?  Unit conversion problems can occur when mixing
  different size units.
  - [ ] The units balance for all equations
  - [ ] The names of units named after people are in lower-case
  - [ ] All symbols used in the document are listed in the table of symbols
  - [ ] All symbols listed in the table of symbols are used in the document
  - [ ] All symbols have unique definitions; that is, no two symbols have the
  same definition
  - [ ] All abbreviations/acronyms used in the document are listed in the table
    of abbreviations/acronyms
  - [ ] All abbreviations/acronyms listed in the table of abbreviations/acronyms
    are used in the document
  - [ ] If a domain specific notation will be used, it has been defined in the
    mathematical notation section

### Introduction
  - [ ] Introductory blurb focuses on the problem domain
  - [ ] Introductory blurb Includes a "roadmap"
  - [ ] "Purpose of the Document" discusses the documentation's purpose, not
    the program's purpose
  - [ ] Scope of the requirements is an abstract version of the assumptions.
    Every item of the scope should be reflected in at least one assumption.
  - [ ] Characteristics of the intended reader are not confused with the user
    characteristics
  - [ ] Characteristics of the intended reader are unambiguous (typically list
  courses and their level)
  - [ ] The software application or library is given a name
  - [ ] The project is explicitly identified as either software app or library

### General System Description
  - [ ] System context includes a figure showing the relation between the
    software system and external entities
  - [ ] If the software will depend on other software, such as other libraries,
    this is part of the system context.  Try to keep the libraries generic,
    unless specific libraries are needed, which will mean software constaints
    are also specified.
  - [ ] User characteristics are unambiguous (for instance, don't just say the user will know
    physics, say they will know Newtonian mechanics as typically covered in the
    first year of an engineering or science degree)
  - [ ] User characteristics are specific
  - [ ] System constraints have an appropriate rationale (a constraint without a
    reason for that constraint is likely making the SRS less abstract than it
    should be)

### Problem Description
  - [ ] Each item of the physical system is identified and labelled
  - [ ] Goal statements are functional
  - [ ] Goal statements are abstract
  - [ ] Goal statements use a minimal amount of technical language,
    understandable by non-domain experts

### Solution Characteristics Specification
  - [ ] Each assumption is "atomic" (no explicit or implicit "ands")
  - [ ] Assumptions are a refinement of the scope
  - [ ] Each assumption is referenced (invoked) at least once in the document
  - [ ] If an assumption is listed as being referenced by another chunk (T, IM
    etc), that other chunk should explicitly invoke the assumption in the
    describing text or derivation
  - [ ] A link exists between each chunk and anything that references it
  - [ ] If the "Ref.\ By" field is filled in, the entities (model, definition,
    assumption) listed explicitly include a reference to the original entity
    (model, definition, assumption).
  - [ ] The rationale is given for assumptions that require justification
  - [ ] The derivation of all GDs as refinements from other models is clear
  - [ ] The derivation of all IMs as refinements from other models is clear
  - [ ] All DD are used (referenced) by at least one other model
  - [ ] The IMs remain abstract
  - [ ] All of the inputs for an IM are used in some way to define the output for the IM
  - [ ] Input data constraints are given, with a rationale where appropriate
  - [ ] Properties of a correct solution are given (or explicitly left blank)
  - [ ] Equations are balanced with respect to units of all terms
  - [ ] All "chunks" (theories, definitions, models) are used (invoked,
  referred to) at least once

### Functional Requirements
  - [ ] IMs and (possibly) TMs and GMs are referenced as appropriate by the
    requirements.  It is a sign that the IMs are not set correctly if there is
    one or more IMs that are not referenced by any of the requirements.
  - [ ] All requirements are validatable
  - [ ] All requirements are abstract
  - [ ] Requirements are traceable to where the required details are found in
    the document

### Nonfunctional Requirements
  - [ ] NFRs are verifiable
  - [ ] Usability used for users and understandability used for programmers

### Likely and Unlikely changes
  - [ ] Likely changes are feasible to hide in the design

### Traceability Matrices
  - [ ] Traceability matrix is complete
