# Kathará Lab Checker

## What is it?

Kathará Lab Checker is a tool to automatically check Kathará network scenarios. The tool leverages on a configuration
file (no coding) to specify the tests to run on the scenarios and then outputs files containing the results of the
tests.

The tool is very effective for automatically correct student homeworks, exams and network scenario configurations.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install kathara-lab-checker
```

The Python version MUST be `>=3.11`.

## How does it work?

The Kathará Lab Checker takes in input a configuration file specifying the tests to perform and the expected values.
To run the tool you only need to run the `main.py` passing the desired configuration file.

```bash
python3 -m kathara_lab_checker --config <path-to-the-configuration-file> --labs <path-to-the-labs-directory>
```

At this point, the tool parses the provided configuration file and executes the tests. For each network scenario the
tool creates a report file in the network scenario directory.

The file is composed of three sheets:

1. `Summary`: Contains a summary of the results.
2. `All`: Contains the results for each test.
3. `Failed`: Contains only the results of failed tests.

By default, reports are generated as a set of CSV files; however, you can choose to generate a consolidated Excel
spreadsheet or disable report generation entirely using the `--report-type` flag.

After all the network scenarios are tested, a combined report (either `results.xlsx` or `results.csv`, as selected) is
placed in the network scenarios
directory containing all the results for each network scenario, including the reasons for failed tests.

## Running the example

The repository already provide a complete example with the results of the tests.

- Check the test configuration by inspecting: [configuration_palabra.json](examples/palabra/correction.json).
- Check the network topology and requisites: [palabra.pdf](examples/palabra/palabra.pdf)
- Check final results summary: [results.xlsx](examples/palabra/results.xlsx)

You can re-run the example by typing the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
python3 -m kathara_lab_checker --config examples/palabra/correction.json --no-cache --labs examples/palabra/labs
```

The `--no-cache` flag force to repeat already executed tests.

## Running on Docker

To build a Docker image containing both `Kathará` and the `kathara-lab-checker` tool, follow
the [guide](scripts/docker).

## How to configure?

The `structure` file can be written in either **JSON** or **YAML** format. With **YAML**, you may inline your Kathará
lab structure under `lab_inline`. If you specify it like in the following, the tool uses it as your `structure` file
automatically.

```yaml
lab_inline: |
  router1[0]="net12"
  router2[0]="net12"
  ...
```

In the following you will find the possible values for the configuration file.
