[Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/): LLM should read this page when implementing human-in-the-loop workflows in LangGraph, designing approval systems with LLMs, or creating interactive multi-turn conversation agents. This page explains human-in-the-loop patterns in LangGraph using the interrupt function, showing how to pause graph execution for human review/input and resume with Command. Includes design patterns for approval workflows, state editing, tool call reviews, and multi-turn conversations, with code examples and warnings about execution flow and common pitfalls.
