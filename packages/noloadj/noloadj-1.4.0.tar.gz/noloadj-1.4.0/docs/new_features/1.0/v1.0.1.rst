===========================
Version available since October 20th 2021


New Features
------------
- Optimizations run with automatic differentiation library Jax (quicker than Autograd library).
- Optimization problems with mono or two-objective function can be solved.
- Optimization problems with "mixed" constraints (scalars and vectorials) and/or mixed inputs can be solved.

Changes
------------
- In Tools.py, "Structlist" class replaces "flatten" and "unflattened" functions.
- In wrapper.py, a new method "dictionnary" in wrapper class was created to compute "rawResults" attribute.
- To give specifications, users must use dictionnaries for variables and constraints instead of two lists for each (names + values).
