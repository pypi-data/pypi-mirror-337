_AI search is like a box of FORcolates. You never know what you're gonna get._



Forcolate is a versatile library designed to enhance semantic search capabilities, in particular in a setting where it is deployed locally (and not in a cloud environment). It offers a suite of tools that facilitate efficient and intelligent search functionalities, making it easier to find relevant information within large datasets.

## Features

- **Semantic Search Utilities wrapper**: Utilize advanced semantic search algorithms to retrieve relevant information based on context and meaning, rather than simple keyword matching.
- **Outlook Email Search**: Integrate semantic search with Microsoft Outlook using the Win32 API to search through emails intelligently.


## Installation

To install the Forcolate library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install forcolate
```

## Usage

### Semantic Search for Outlook Emails

The Forcolate library includes a tool for performing semantic search on Outlook emails using the Win32 API. Below is an example of how to use this tool:

```python
from forcolate import process_outlook_emails

save_directory = "path/to/save/directory"
query = "your search query"

file_paths = process_outlook_emails(save_directory, threshold, query, limit)
print(file_paths)

```

## Contributing

Contributions to the Forcolate library are welcome! If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
