# Requirements
To use scripts with the library, make sure you have ffmpeg installed. If not, install it from here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
  * If you want to use example.py, modify line 21 with your file path: 
    converter = Mp4ToScrConverter(ffmpeg_path="C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe") #change to your file path
    * If you put ffmpeg folder into C:/ (your ffmpeg folder path is C:/ffmpeg/), you don't need to change anything.
# How to install
* Simply install it via "pip install vidToScr".
  # Manually:
  * install source code from .zip file (or other from repo)
  * run "python -m build"
# Future Additions
