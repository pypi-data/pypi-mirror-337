[this guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/graph/): LLM should read this page when: 1) Building a question-answering system over a graph database 2) Implementing text-to-query generation for graph databases 3) Learning techniques for query validation and error handling 'This page covers building a question-answering application over a graph database using LangChain. It provides a basic implementation using the GraphQACypherChain, followed by an advanced implementation with LangGraph. The latter includes techniques like few-shot prompting, query validation, and error handling for generating accurate Cypher queries from natural language.'
