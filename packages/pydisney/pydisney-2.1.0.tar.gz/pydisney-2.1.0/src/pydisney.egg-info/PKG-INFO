# Disney+ API wrapper

A feature rich API wrapper for Disney+ made with python.


## How to install
    pip install pydisney

https://pypi.org/project/pydisney

## Usage/Examples

### Simple search
```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI

api = DisneyAPI(email="email", password="password")
searches = api.search("Star wars")
print(searches[0].title) # prints title of the first search hit
```
### More examples

```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI, Rating, Language

# forces to use disney's login api instead of cached access and refresh tokens
api = DisneyAPI(email="email", password="password", force_login=True)

profile = api.get_profiles()  # grabs the first profile
print(api.set_active_profile(profile.id)) # if profile is locked, pass pin as an argument
active_profile = api.get_active_profile()
active_profile.set_profile_language(Language.English_UK) # sets language to english, from now all data will be returned in that language


searches = api.search("Star wars")
print(searches[0].title)

# checks if the search hit is a series or a movie
if searches[0].is_movie:
    print(searches[0].durationMs)  # returns in milliseconds
    print(searches[0].cast)

else:
    # prints s01e01's full description
    print(searches[0].seasons[0].episodes[0].full_description)
```
