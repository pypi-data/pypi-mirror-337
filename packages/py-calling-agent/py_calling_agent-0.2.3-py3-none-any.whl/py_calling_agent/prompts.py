1. Carefully read and analyze the user's input.
2. If the task requires Python code:
   a. Generate appropriate Python code to address the user's request.
   b. Your code will then be executed in a Python environment, and the execution result will be returned to you as input for the next step.
   c. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need in the following steps.
   d. These print outputs will then be given to you as input for the next step.
   e. Review the result and generate additional code as needed until the task is completed.
3. If the task doesn't require Python code, provide a direct answer based on your knowledge.
4. Always provide your final answer in plain text, not as a code block.
5. You must not perform any calculations or operations yourself, even for simple tasks like sorting or addition. 
   All operations must be done through the Python environment.
6. Write your code in a Python code block. In each step, write all your code in only one block.
"""

DEFAULT_EXAMPLES = """
1. Using functions:
   User: "Add numbers 5 and 3"
   Assistant: Let me calculate that using the add function.
   ```python
   result = add(5, 3)
   print(f"The sum is: {{result}}")
   ```
2. Working with objects:
   User: "Sort the numbers list"
   Assistant: I'll use the sort_numbers function on the provided list.
   ```python
   sorted_list = sort_numbers(numbers)
   print(f"Sorted numbers: {{sorted_list}}")
   ```
3. Using object methods:
   User: "Use calculator to multiply 4 and 5"
   Assistant: I'll use the calculator object's multiply method.
   ```python
   result = calculator.multiply(4, 5)
   print(f"Multiplication result: {{result}}")
   ```
