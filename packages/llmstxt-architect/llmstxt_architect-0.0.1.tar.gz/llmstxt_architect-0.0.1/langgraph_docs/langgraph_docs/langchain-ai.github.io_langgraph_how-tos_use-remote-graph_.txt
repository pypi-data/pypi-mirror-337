[How to interact with the deployment using RemoteGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/use-remote-graph/): LLM should read this page when needing to interact with LangGraph Platform deployments remotely, when implementing RemoteGraph interfaces, or when using deployed graphs as subgraphs. This page explains how to use RemoteGraph to interact with LangGraph Platform deployments, covering initialization methods (URL-based or client-based), synchronous/asynchronous invocation, thread-level persistence, and using RemoteGraph as a subgraph in larger applications.
