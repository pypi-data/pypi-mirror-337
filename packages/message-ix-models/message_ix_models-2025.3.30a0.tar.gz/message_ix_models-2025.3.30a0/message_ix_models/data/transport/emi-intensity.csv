#   - Sector: Civil aviation (domestic, LTO)
#     → technology=AIR
#   - Table: Table_3-3
#   - Type: Tier 1 Emission Factor
#   - Technology: NA
#   - Fuel: Jet Gasoline and Aviation Gasoline
#   - Abatement: (empty)
#   - Region: NA
#   - Pollutant → emission
#   - CI_lower, CI_upper, Reference → preserved as comments
#   - Unit: kg/tonne fuel, which is equivalent to g / kg fuel.
