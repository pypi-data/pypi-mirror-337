## Features

### Password Breach Checker

Check if a password has been exposed in known data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API (via k-anonymity for safety).

### Password Auditor

Evaluate a password’s strength based on:

- Entropy (randomness)
- Common weak patterns
- Length & character variety  
  Includes suggestions for improving weak passwords.

### Phishing Link Scanner

Scan suspicious URLs using the [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com) API and detect if they’re malicious or flagged by security engines.
