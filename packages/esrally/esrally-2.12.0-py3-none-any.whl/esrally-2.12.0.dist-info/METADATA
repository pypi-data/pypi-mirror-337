Rally is the macrobenchmarking framework for Elasticsearch

## What is Rally?

You want to benchmark Elasticsearch? Then Rally is for you. It can help you with the following tasks:

* Setup and teardown of an Elasticsearch cluster for benchmarking
* Management of benchmark data and specifications even across Elasticsearch versions
* Running benchmarks and recording results
* Finding performance problems by attaching so-called telemetry devices
* Comparing performance results

We have also put considerable effort in Rally to ensure that benchmarking data are reproducible.

## Quick Start

Rally is developed for Unix and is actively tested on Linux and macOS. Rally supports [benchmarking Elasticsearch clusters running on Windows](http://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#benchmarking-an-existing-cluster) but Rally itself needs to be installed on machines running Unix.

### Installing Rally

**Note**: If you actively develop on Elasticsearch, we recommend that you [install Rally in development mode](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing.html#installation-instructions-for-development) instead as Elasticsearch is fast moving and Rally always adapts accordingly to the latest main version.

Install Python 3.9+ including `pip3`, git 1.9+ and an [appropriate JDK to run Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm). Be sure that `JAVA_HOME` points to that JDK. Then run the following command, optionally prefixed by `sudo` if necessary:

    pip3 install esrally


If you have any trouble or need more detailed instructions, please look in the [detailed installation guide](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Run your first race

Now we're ready to run our first race:

    esrally race --distribution-version=6.0.0 --track=geonames

This will download Elasticsearch 6.0.0 and run Rally's default track - the [geonames track](https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks/tree/master/geonames) - against it. After the race, a summary report is written to the command line:
