[How to: retrieve the whole document for a chunk](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/parent_document_retriever): LLM should read this page when [1) wanting to retrieve larger documents instead of just smaller chunks for context, 2) trying to balance keeping context while splitting long documents] [The page explains how to use the ParentDocumentRetriever, which first splits documents into small chunks for indexing but then retrieves the larger parent documents those chunks came from during retrieval. It shows code examples for retrieving full documents as well as larger chunks rather than full documents.]
