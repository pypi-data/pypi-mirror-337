# Kamiwaza Python SDK

Python client library and CLI for interacting with the Kamiwaza AI Platform. This SDK provides a type-safe interface to all Kamiwaza API endpoints with built-in authentication, error handling, and resource management.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kamiwaza-client
```

## Python SDK Usage

```python
from kamiwaza_client import KamiwazaClient

# Initialize the client for local development
client = KamiwazaClient("http://localhost:7777/api/")
```

## Examples

The `/examples` directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various use cases:

1. [Model Download and Deployment](examples/01_download_and_deploy.ipynb) - A comprehensive guide to searching, downloading, deploying, and using models with the Kamiwaza SDK
2. [Quick Model Deployment](examples/02_download_and_deploy_quick.ipynb) - Streamlined approach to download and deploy models using a single function
3. [Model Evaluation](examples/03_eval_multiple_models.ipynb) - How to evaluate and benchmark multiple language models for performance comparison using the streamlined `download_and_deploy_model` function
4. [Structured Output](examples/04_structured_output.ipynb) - Using Kamiwaza's OpenAI-compatible interface to generate structured outputs with specific JSON schemas

More examples coming soon!

## Quick Start - CLI

The easiest way to get started is using the CLI:

```bash
# First time setup
kamiwaza config set-url http://localhost:7777/api

# Download, deploy, and chat with a model in one command
$ kamiwaza run qwen2.5-7b-instruct
ðŸš€ Deploying Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF...
âœ¨ Deployment ready!

ðŸ¤– Chat session started (Ctrl+C to exit)

User: What is a funny way to explain GenAI?

Assistant: GenAI is like a magic wand that can create amazing things. It can write code, draw pictures, and even figure out your taxes.
```
