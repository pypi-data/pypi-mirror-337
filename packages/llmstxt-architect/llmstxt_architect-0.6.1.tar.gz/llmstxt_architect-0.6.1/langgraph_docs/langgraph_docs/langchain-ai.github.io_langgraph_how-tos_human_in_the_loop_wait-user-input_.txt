[How to wait for user input using interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input/): LLM should read this page when implementing wait-for-user functions in LangGraph, implementing human-in-the-loop interactions, or learning how to use the interrupt() function. This page explains how to pause graph execution to collect user input using LangGraph's interrupt() function, with examples of simple feedback collection and more complex agent interactions that ask clarifying questions.
