# Using the Alexandria app

The Alexandria app provides a view on the data of contained in the Alexandria dataset, as provided by the [Alexandria database](https://alexandria.icams.rub.de/).   

Here, we note how to interact with the app, as it is deployed on the [central NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu).

## Data

The Alexandia database consists of DFT calculations that were performed with the code VASP, using consistent numerical settings. For all materials, both the cell parameters and the atomic positions were relaxed. To do so, several relaxation steps were performed. This app filters the data available in NOMAD such that only the data obtained by the final calculation of this workflow are presented.  

The data can be explored in the GUI, in the same way as the regular NOMAD (see [the documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/howto/manage/explore.html)).
