[](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/vectorstores/): LLM should read this page when needing to index and retrieve information based on semantic similarity, needing to work with vector embeddings of data, or needing to understand how vector stores fit into the LangChain architecture. Vector stores are specialized data stores that enable indexing and retrieving information based on vector representations called embeddings. The page covers the vector store interface, initialization, adding/deleting documents, similarity search, metadata filtering, and advanced retrieval techniques.
