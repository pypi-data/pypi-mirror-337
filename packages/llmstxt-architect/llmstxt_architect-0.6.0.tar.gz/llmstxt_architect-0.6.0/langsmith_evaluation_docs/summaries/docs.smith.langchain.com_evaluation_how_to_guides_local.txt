[How to run an evaluation locally (beta, Python only) | ü¶úÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/local): LLM should read this page when learning how to run evaluations locally without uploading results to LangSmith, when testing prompts quickly, or when validating target/evaluator functions. The page explains how to use the Python SDK's evaluate() function with upload_results=False parameter to run evaluations locally, with an example showing how to define evaluators, test a chatbot on a dataset, and analyze results locally with pandas.
