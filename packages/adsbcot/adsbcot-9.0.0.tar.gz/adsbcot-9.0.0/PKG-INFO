# Display Aircraft in TAK - ADS-B to TAK Gateway 

ADSBCOT is software for monitoring and analyzing aviation surveillance data via the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem of products.

ADSBCOT captures & reports real-time ADS-B data received from aircraft (or other aerial vehicles) into TAK products using native TAK protocols, including Cursor on Target (CoT). 

[Documentation is available here.](https://adsbcot.rtfd.io)


   Use ADS-B Aggregators with [ADSBXCOT](https://adsbxcot.rtfd.io).

   The stand-alone [AirTAK](https://www.snstac.com/store/p/airtak-v1) is a portable ADS-B to TAK Gateway.
