### Follows [writing checklist](https://github.com/ssm-lab/capstone--source-code-optimizer/blob/main/docs/Checklists/Writing-Checklist.pdf)
  - [ ] LaTeX points
  - [ ] Structure
  - [ ] Spelling, grammar, attention to detail
  - [ ] Avoid low information content phrases
  - [ ] Writing style
### Follows the template, all parts present
  - [ ] Table of contents
  - [ ] Pages are numbered
  - [ ] Revision history included for major revisions
  - [ ] Sections from template are all present
  - [ ] Values of auxiliary constants are given (constants are used to improve
    maintainability and to increase understandability)

### Grammar, spelling, presentation
  - [ ] No spelling mistakes (use a spell checker!)
  - [ ] No grammar mistakes (review, ask someone else to review (at least a few
    sections))
  - [ ] Paragraphs are structured well (clear topic sentence, cohesive)
  - [ ] Paragraphs are concise (not wordy)
  - [ ] No Low Information Content (LIC) phrases
    ([List
      of LIC phrases](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/range357/extra-refs/empty-words.htm))
  - [ ] All hyperlinks work
  - [ ] Every figure has a caption
  - [ ] Every table has a heading
  - [ ] Symbolic names are used for quantities, rather than literal values

### LaTeX
  - [ ] Template comments do not show in the pdf version, either by
    removing them, or by turning them off.
  - [ ] References and labels are used so that maintenance is feasible

### Overall qualities of documentation
  - [ ] Test cases include SPECIFIC input
  - [ ] Test cases include EXPLICIT output
  - [ ] Description over specification, when appropriate
  - [ ] Plans for what to do with description data (performance, usability, etc).
  This may involve saying what plots will be generated.
  - [ ] Plans to quantify error for scalar values using relative error
  - [ ] Plans to quantify error for vector and matrix values using a norm of an error
  vector (matrix)
  - [ ] Plans are feasible (can be accomplished with resources available)
  - [ ] Plans are ambitious enough for an A+ effort
  - [ ] Survey questions for usability survey are in an Appendix (if appropriate)
  - [ ] Plans for task based inspection, if appropriate
  - [ ] Very careful use of random testing
  - [ ] Specific programming language is listed
  - [ ] Specific linter tool is listed (if appropriate)
  - [ ] Specific coding standard is given
  - [ ] Specific unit testing framework is given
  - [ ] Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
  - [ ] Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
  - [ ] Specific performance measuring tools listed (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
  - [ ] Traceability between test cases and requirements is summarized (likely in
  a table)
