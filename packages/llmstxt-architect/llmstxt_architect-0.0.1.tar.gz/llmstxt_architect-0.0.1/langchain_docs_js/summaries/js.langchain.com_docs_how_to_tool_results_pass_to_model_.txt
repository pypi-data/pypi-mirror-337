[](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_results_pass_to_model/): LLM should read this page when it needs to pass tool outputs to chat models, when it needs to use chat models to call tools, when it needs to invoke tool functions using arguments generated by a chat model. This page explains how to define tools, instantiate a chat model, get the model to generate tool calls, invoke the tool functions using the arguments provided by the model, and feed the tool results back to the model to generate a final answer.
