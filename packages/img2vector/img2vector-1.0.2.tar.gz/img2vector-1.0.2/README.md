img2vector is an advanced image-to-SVG conversion library with intelligent detection technology that automatically analyzes image types and optimizes vectorization parameters for superior results. Created to solve the challenge of finding optimal conversion settings for different types of images.

## üî• Features

- **Intelligent Image Analysis:** Automatically identifies whether your image is a line drawing, technical diagram, photo, or geometric shapes using a custom-built computer vision algorithm
- **Parameter Optimization:** Selects the perfect conversion parameters based on content analysis, eliminating trial-and-error
- **Multiple Vectorization Modes:** Choose between spline mode (for smooth curves) and polygon mode (for precise edges) based on your needs
- **Smart Preprocessing:** Four levels of image enhancement from light to heavy to handle noisy or low-quality source images
- **Clean, Optimized SVGs:** Produces high-quality vector graphics with minimal file size and node count
- **Intuitive Web Interface:** Easy-to-use Gradio UI for quick conversions without coding
- **Programmer API:** Full Python API for integration into automated workflows

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Web Interface

The easiest way to try img2vector is through the web interface:

```bash
pip install img2vector
python -m img2vector.app
```

### Python API

```python
from img2vector import convert_image

# Simple conversion with auto-optimization
convert_image("input.png", "output.svg")

# Advanced usage
from img2vector import Img2Vector, detect_image_type

# Create converter instance
converter = Img2Vector()

# Detect image type (using the standalone function)
image_type = detect_image_type("input.png")
print(f"Detected image type: {image_type}")

# Custom conversion
converter.convert(
    "input.png", 
    "output.svg",
    auto_optimize=True,
    preprocessing_level="medium"
)
```

## üîç Conversion Options Explained

### Preprocessing Levels

When converting images, img2vector offers different preprocessing levels to optimize results for various image types:

- **None**: No additional preprocessing applied. The image is still converted to a compatible format for processing but without filters or enhancements. Best for clean, high-quality images with clear lines and shapes.
  
- **Light**: Basic noise reduction and contrast enhancement. Good for slightly noisy images or photos with moderate detail.
  
- **Medium**: More aggressive denoising and edge enhancement. Excellent for technical drawings, diagrams, or images with important line work that needs to be preserved while removing noise.
  
- **Heavy**: Applies thresholding and morphological operations for maximum clarity. Best for sketches, hand-drawn content, or images where you want to extract only the most prominent features.

### Auto-Optimization

The `auto_optimize` parameter enables img2vector's intelligent detection system:

- When set to `True` (default), the system analyzes your image to identify its type and automatically selects optimal parameters.
  
- When set to `False`, you can manually control all conversion parameters like color mode, hierarchical mode, and various thresholds.

### Example Output By Image Type

| Image Type | Recommended Preprocessing | Expected Results |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Line Drawing | Light to Medium | Clean paths with smooth curves, minimal nodes |
| Technical Drawing | None to Light | Precise corners, accurate straight lines |
| Geometric Shapes | None | Perfect circles, squares, and other primitives |
| Diagram | Medium | Clear connection lines, preserved structure |
| Photo | Light to Medium | Balanced detail preservation with manageable file size |

### Advanced Parameters

For users who need fine-grained control, img2vector exposes additional parameters:

```python
converter.convert(
    "input.png",
    "output.svg",
    auto_optimize=False,
    preprocessing_level="medium",
    colormode="color",       # "color" or "binary"
    hierarchical="stacked",  # "stacked" or "cutout"
    mode="spline",           # "spline" or "polygon"
    filter_speckle=4,        # 0-20 (higher removes more small details)
    color_precision=6,       # 1-10 (higher preserves more color accuracy)
    layer_difference=16,     # 1-32 (controls how colors are grouped)
    corner_threshold=60,     # 0-180 (higher creates more corners)
    length_threshold=4.0,    # 0-10 (higher simplifies paths more)
    max_iterations=10,       # 1-20 (higher improves optimization)
    splice_threshold=45,     # 0-90 (controls path joining)
    path_precision=3         # 1-10 (controls decimal precision)
)
```

## ‚ú® Why img2vector?

Traditional vectorization tools use one-size-fits-all settings, requiring users to manually tweak numerous parameters through trial and error. img2vector leverages computer vision to analyze your specific image and automatically apply custom-tailored optimization. The result?

- Cleaner SVGs with fewer unnecessary nodes
- Smaller file sizes without quality loss
- Better visual quality with appropriate path types
- Significant time savings from automated parameter selection
- Consistent results across different image types

## üåü Technical Highlights

img2vector's image detection algorithm uses multiple factors to analyze images:

- Edge density analysis for determining image complexity
- Histogram entropy calculation for texture analysis
- Hough transform for line and shape detection
- Texture complexity scoring for material differentiation
- Color complexity measurement for photo identification

After detection, the system applies specialized parameter sets optimized through extensive testing for each image category.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Development

Upcoming features planned for img2vector:

- Batch processing for converting multiple images
- Enhanced color quantization options
- Custom presets for recurring image types
- Web API for remote processing
- Additional output formats including PDF and EPS
