    Serves as the abstract base class for all parser implementations.

    Each parser in the library should inherit from this class and implement the `parses` method,
    which is responsible for parsing the corresponding ONNX node and updating the node list
    used ultimately in adding constraints to the Gurobi model.

        Parses the corresponding node and updates the parser's internal representation.

        Args:
            node (dict): A dictionary describing the ONNX node. Expected to have the following keys:
            "name", "type", "input", "output", "attributes", "initializers", and "constants".
            parser: The main parser module, which maintains information like
                current_shape, intermediate_tensors_shapes, and the node list.
