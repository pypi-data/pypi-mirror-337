[How to: handle multiple retrievers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/query_multiple_retrievers): LLM should read this page when needing to handle multiple retrievers for query analysis, when implementing a query analyzer that can select between different retrievers, when building a retrieval-augmented system that needs to choose between different data sources. This page explains how to handle scenarios where a query analysis step allows for selecting between multiple retrievers, showing an example implementation using LangChain's tools for structured output parsing, prompting, and chaining components together.
