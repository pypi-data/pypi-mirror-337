"""Module: engine.py

This module defines an abstract base class for database connection engines (AbstractEngine)
and a concrete base implementation (Engine) that handles common connection setup,
contextâ€‘management, and resource cleanup. Specific engine types (e.g., PyODBC, SQLAlchemy)
should subclass AbstractEngine or Engine and implement the creation and testing of the connection.
