from cython_build_helper import build_helper

# List of file patterns to copy to intermediate directory for Cython preprocessing and compilation.
files_to_intermediate = ["resources", "src", "*.py"]
# List of file patterns to copy to output directory.
files_to_output = ["resources", "call_main.py", "requirements.txt"]
# Directory to output final files.
output_dir = 'dist'

ext_modules, build_options = build_helper.prepare_build_environment(
    files_to_intermediate,
    files_to_output,
    output_dir
)

# you can use `ext_modules` and `build_options` to build your project with setuptools.
# For example, you can use `setuptools.setup` to build your project.
setup(
    name="my_project",
    ext_modules=ext_modules,
