# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is in the **implementation stage** with core MCP server functionality implemented and enhanced image handling capabilities added. We are focusing on practical features and MCP compliance.

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Basic MCP server implementation in `server.py`
- ✅ `image_analysis` tool for general image analysis
- ✅ Support for multiple image input formats:
  - ✅ Base64-encoded image data
  - ✅ Image URLs (http/https)
  - ✅ Local file paths
- ✅ Support for multiple vision models from OpenRouter
- ✅ Basic environment variable configuration
- ✅ Error handling via `exceptions.py`

### Documentation

- ✅ Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Examples for different image input methods
- ✅ Development documentation in `.ai/memory-bank/` directory

### Testing

- ✅ Unit tests for core functionality
- ✅ Tests for all image input formats
- ✅ Mocked API responses for predictable testing

## What's Left to Build

### Enhancement Opportunities

- ⬜ Additional image preprocessing utilities
- ⬜ Support for more specialized vision tasks
- ⬜ Performance optimization for large images

### Documentation Improvements

- ⬜ More comprehensive examples for all models
- ⬜ Troubleshooting guide with common errors

## Recent Progress

1. **Enhanced Image Handling**:

   - Added support for image URLs
   - Added support for local file paths
   - Implemented automatic conversion to base64
   - Added robust detection of input formats

2. **Improved Testing**:

   - Added tests for all image input formats
   - Implemented test fixtures for consistent testing
   - Added mocked API responses

3. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Applied black formatting to all code
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added more comprehensive type hints

## Known Issues

1. **Test Coverage**: Could benefit from even more comprehensive tests
2. **Documentation**: Examples could be expanded for more use cases
