## dbt-watsonx-presto

[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

dbt is the T in ELT. Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.

### Overview

The `dbt-watsonx-presto` adapter uses [Presto](https://prestodb.io/) as the underlying SQL query engine to enable powerful data transformations and query federation across diverse data sources. With Presto, you can connect to multiple data systems (via available connectors) through a single dbt connection and process SQL queries efficiently at scale.

Transformations defined in dbt are passed to Presto, which executes these SQL queries by translating them into queries specific to the connected systems. Presto then creates tables, builds views, or manipulates data as defined by your dbt project.

This repository is an evolution of the [dbt-presto](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-presto) adapter, specifically designed for seamless compatibility with both [open-source Presto](https://prestodb.io/) and IBM [watsonx.data Presto](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data) instances.
