RRMScorer allows the user to easily predict how likely a single RRM is to bind ssRNA using a carefully generated alignment for the RRM structures in complex with RNA, from which we analyzed the interaction patterns and derived the scores.

**üîó RRMScorer is also available online now! (https://bio2byte.be/rrmscorer/)**

From _"Deciphering the RRM-RNA recognition code: A computational analysis"_ publication:

> RNA recognition motifs (RRM) are the most prevalent class of RNA binding domains in eucaryotes. Their RNA binding preferences have been investigated for almost two decades, and even though some RRM domains are now very well described, their RNA recognition code has remained elusive. An increasing number of experimental structures of RRM-RNA complexes has become available in recent years. Here, we perform an in-depth computational analysis to derive an RNA recognition code for canonical RRMs. We present and validate a computational scoring method to estimate the binding between an RRM and a single stranded RNA, based on structural data from a carefully curated multiple sequence alignment, which can predict RRM binding RNA sequence motifs based on the RRM protein sequence. Given the importance and prevalence of RRMs in humans and other species, this tool could help design RNA binding motifs with uses in medical or synthetic biology applications, leading towards the de novo design of RRMs with specific RNA recognition.

Please address to the publication for more details on the method REF.

### Pip package installation
> pip is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes.

- [PyPi package for RRMScorer](https://pypi.org/project/rrmscorer/)
- [Bioconda recipe for RRMScorer](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/rrmscorer/README.html)

```bash
$ pip install rrmscorer
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important note:**
Apple silicon users may need to install the package in a Rosetta environment, using conda for isntance, bacause some packages are not available for the silicon architecture yet.
```bash
$ CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create -n rosetta_environment
```

## Features

RRMScorer has several features to either calculate the binding score for a specific RRM and RNA sequences, for a set of RRM sequences in a FASTA file, or to explore which are the best RNA binders according to our scoring method.

$ rrmscorer --help
