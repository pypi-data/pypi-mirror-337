API Reference
=============

Welcome to the **TFiltersPy** API Reference - where filtering gets fun! 🎉 Just like scikit-learn, we've kept our API intuitive, so you can focus on crunching numbers and filtering noise without all the boring bits. 😎

Overview
--------
**TFiltersPy** is here to help you tame unruly data with a range of filtering algorithms. Whether you're a wizard of linear systems 🧙‍♂️ or a champion of nonlinear chaos 🤹‍♀️, our filters are designed to be as straightforward (and fun) as possible.

Key Concepts:
---------
- **fit()**: Initialize or train your filter - think of it as setting up your filtering magic ✨.

- **predict()**: Wave your wand and generate state estimates from new measurements 🪄.

- **run_filter()**: Process a sequence of measurements for a full filtering extravaganza 🎢.

- **estimate_parameters()**: Let the filter automatically figure out optimal settings (because who wants to do that manually? 🤷‍♂️).

Key Classes
-----------
- **BaseEstimator**  
  The foundation of our filtering magic. It handles parameter management, validation, and even some neat utility tricks like converting NumPy arrays to Dask arrays. 🔧

- **ParameterEstimator**  
  A bit more advanced - it adds methods for Bayesian parameter estimation using fun strategies like residual analysis, maximum likelihood, cross-validation, and adaptive filtering. 🎯

- **DaskKalmanFilter**  
  Our distributed wizard for linear state estimation, leveraging Dask to handle massive data sets with ease. It's as efficient as it is elegant. 🚀

- **ParticleFilter**  
  For when your system is too wild for a Kalman filter, our Particle Filter uses a swarm of particles to track nonlinear, non-Gaussian systems. It's like herding cats - but with probabilities! 🐱🎲

Additional Notes
----------------
We designed **TFiltersPy** to be:

- **Simple & Intuitive:** No need to get bogged down in boilerplate—get filtering done with minimal fuss. 👍

- **Extensible:** Customize and extend the filters to suit your unique data adventures. 🔄

- **Distributed:** Built to work with Dask, so even your largest datasets can be tamed. 🌐
