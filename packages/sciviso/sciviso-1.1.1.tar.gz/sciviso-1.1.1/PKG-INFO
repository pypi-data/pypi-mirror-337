## A wrapper to format all plots the same 

Sci-viso is a wrapper around matplotlib and seaborn. These are already great libraries, but as I needed to generate
figures for publication, I found that I had specific formats that I needed, and continually adding these in was
making my code clunky and repetative. I also wanted my charts within a publication to have the same "look and feel",
like palette, font, sizing etc. So I made sciviso so that my figures could come out of python "publication ready" and
asthetic.

I have only made wrappers for charts that I use (obvs) but keen for people to add others or make suggestions (feel free
to do that via github issues).
