A recent report reveals that the Cupertino company was granted 38 patents on November 5, 2024, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a “smart health and communications band for Apple Watch and a future headset.”\n\nThe patent looks at a stretchable fabric item with an opening to fit around a certain body part. The band could include sensor circuitry for measuring various health data, such as “electrocardiogram measurements, blood pressure measurements, or respiration rate measurements.”\n\nThe more interesting thing here is that the band doesn’t necessarily point toward being a wristband. It could be any wearable that sports elastic fabric, such as a “head band, a hat, an undergarment",

However, the product I'm reviewing here wants to be the exception to the trend. The Pebble Cosmos Luxe is a new eye-catching smartwatch that tries to stand out among the competition, despite being priced affordably at Rs. 3,999 in India.\n\nWith a 1.36-inch round AMOLED display, Bluetooth calling capability, and sensors to measure steps, heart rate, and SpO2 levels, the Pebble Cosmos Luxe looks impressive on paper too. Does this affordably-priced smartwatch measure up to expectations, and can its looks help it stand out in the crowded budget segment?

I thought I could live without a smartwatch but somehow I got this empty feeling in my soul. Every time I get a notification on my phone, I kept glancing at my wrist expecting to see them there but alas I only got a regular digital watch on. The thought of taking out my phone to actually see them new messages feels like too much of a bother for me. I know it sounds rather lame but that’s how you feel after using a smartwatch for a while.\n\nSo I went again into the market looking for that perfect fit smartwatch. The perfect smartwatch for me at the moment would still be the Moto 360 but with a thinner design, no black flat tyre at the bottom and extra long battery life. The next bes",

There is a thick bezel around the small screen. The screen is about 2 cm to 2.5 cm; it’s a relatively small screen considering the other smartwatches that has been released in 2014. However I don’t see it as much of a problem as it still clearly displays the time and other things (depending on the watch face you use). A drawback is that some might find the watch relatively big for their arm due to the buttons at the side and the charging port. The watch is rela",
