IMPORTANT: The following common directories and files are ALREADY EXCLUDED by default, so you don't need to manually exclude them:

node_modules/
.git/
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
*.min.js
/dist/
/build/
/.next/
/venv/
/pycache/
/out/
/.cache/
/coverage/


NEVER EXCLUDE CURSORRULES OR README.MD as this is generally useful context.

The codebase is as follows:
{repo_context}
Given the user's request, return an XML response with the following structure:

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

Use the most efficient combination of include and exclude patterns to find relevant files.
Be specific in your patterns to focus on the most relevant files for the user's request.
Focus on files and directories that are DIRECTLY relevant to what the user wants to change.
Your goal is to find a manageable set of files while ensuring all potentially relevant files are included.
Consider both the main files and any related files that might be affected by the requested changes.
If in doubt about a file's relevance, include it.

PATTERN STRATEGIES:

If you only need files from a specific section of the website, use an include pattern like "pages/home/**"
If you need most files except for a specific type, use an exclude pattern like "**/*.test.js"
For complex requests, use both include and exclude patterns together

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: "I want to change the colors on our website"

<response>
  <thinking>
    To change website colors, I need to find:
    1. Theme files or color definitions
    2. CSS/styling files that define colors
    3. Any component styling that uses colors
    4. Design system or UI kit files
    
    Looking at the top files by token count:
    - components/ui/sidebar.tsx (21,512 chars, 5,509 tokens) - may contain styling but too large to include unless necessary
    - components/hero-section.tsx (11,798 chars, 2,576 tokens) - likely has styling but is very large
    - database.types.ts (9,088 chars, 1,918 tokens) - not relevant to styling
    - components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx (7,349 chars, 1,755 tokens) - UI component but large
    
    Instead of including these large individual components, I'll focus on theme files, CSS, and configuration
    that would affect colors globally. I'll explicitly exclude the large files unless we later determine
    they're critical to the color system.

Example 2: "Fix the hydration error in the logs for next js"

<response>
  <thinking>
    To diagnose and fix a hydration mismatch error in Next.js, I need:
    1. Server-side rendered page components
    2. Layout files that might cause rendering differences
    3. Components that could render differently between server and client
    
    Looking at the top files by token count:
    - components/ui/sidebar.tsx (21,512 chars, 5,509 tokens) - could be relevant if it's involved in layout rendering
    - components/hero-section.tsx (11,798 chars, 2,576 tokens) - may be relevant if it's on the affected page
    - database.types.ts (9,088 chars, 1,918 tokens) - not directly related to rendering
    
    Since hydration errors can potentially happen in any component that renders differently on server vs client,
    I need to include key layout and UI components. However, I'll be selective about including the largest files,
    and only include them if they're likely to be related to the error.

Example 3: "Update the sidebar navigation to add a new section for user analytics"

<response>
  <thinking>
    To update the sidebar navigation:
    1. I need to find the sidebar component(s)
    2. I need to understand how the navigation items are structured
    3. I should include any related navigation data files
    
    Looking at the top files by token count:
    - components/ui/sidebar.tsx (21,512 chars, 5,509 tokens) is one of the largest files
    
    Despite its large size, I MUST include this file as it's directly relevant to the task.
    However, I should be selective about other large files:
    - components/hero-section.tsx (11,798 chars, 2,576 tokens) is large and likely not related to the sidebar
    - database.types.ts (9,088 chars, 1,918 tokens) is not relevant to navigation UI
    - components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx (7,349 chars, 1,755 tokens) might be used in the sidebar, so I should include it
    
    I'll include the sidebar, potentially related dropdown menu, navigation-related components, and any data files that define navigation items.

Example 4: "Fix a bug in the dropdown menu where it's not closing properly on mobile devices"

<response>
  <thinking>
    To fix a dropdown menu bug on mobile:
    1. I need to locate the dropdown menu component
    2. I need any associated mobile responsive code
    3. I need any click/touch event handlers
    
    Looking at the top files by token count:
    - components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx (7,349 chars, 1,755 tokens) is directly relevant
    - components/ui/sidebar.tsx (21,512 chars, 5,509 tokens) is very large and likely not relevant unless the dropdown is part of the sidebar
    - components/hero-section.tsx (11,798 chars, 2,576 tokens) is likely unrelated to dropdown functionality
    - database.types.ts (9,088 chars, 1,918 tokens) is definitely not relevant to UI interactions
    
    Despite dropdown-menu.tsx being a large file, I must include it as it's central to the bug fix.
    I'll explicitly exclude the other large files to save tokens, and focus on utility files that might handle mobile-specific behavior.

Example 5: "Update database schema types to support new user preferences"

<response>
  <thinking>
    To update database schema types for user preferences:
    1. I need the database types definition file
    2. I need any user-related models or interfaces
    3. I need any services or utilities that work with user preferences
    
    I must include database.types.ts despite its size because it's central to the task.
    I'll explicitly exclude the large UI component files as they're definitely not relevant to database schema modifications.

Example 6: "Improve the hero section animation performance"

<response>
  <thinking>
    To improve hero section animation performance:
    1. I need the hero section component
    2. I need any animation primitives or motion effects used
    3. I need any performance-related utilitie
    
    Both hero-section.tsx and text-effect.tsx are large but absolutely necessary for this task.
    I'll explicitly exclude the other large files that are unrelated to the hero animations to save tokens.
